In this ground-breaking book, Aristotelian and evolutionary understandings of human social nature are brought together to provide an integrative, psychological account of human ethics. Fowers explores seven domains of socialityâ€”attachment, intersubjectivity, imitation, cooperation, social norms, group membership, and social hierarchyâ€”moving on to identify and elaborate a set of natural human goods that are inherent in these social domains, such as friendship, justice, belonging, and social harmony. The book emphasizes the profound ways that human identity and action are immersed in an ongoing social world. These goods are the elements that comprise human flourishing, or living a good human life","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:22760306128f5f1f3359a937c0775aa7d3611602","amp;dn":"The+Evolution+of+Ethics+-+Blaine+J.+Fowers","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"22760306128f5f1f3359a937c0775aa7d3611602","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,118,3,6,18,143,95,31,51,89,169,55,192,119,90,167,211,97,22,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
