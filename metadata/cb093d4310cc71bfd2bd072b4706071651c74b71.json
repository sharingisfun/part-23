These abilities have left their record in the four intimate Diaries in which he faithfully recorded the events of his inner and outer life from his nineteenth to his fortieth year. Here, together with recollections of his childhood in Bern, his relations with his family and such friends as Kandinsky, Marc, Macke, and many others, his observations on nature and people, his trips to Italy and Tunisia, and his military service, the reader will find Klee's crucial experience with literature and music, as well as many of his essential ideas about his own artistic technique and the creative process","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb093d4310cc71bfd2bd072b4706071651c74b71","amp;dn":"The+Diaries+of+Paul+Klee%2C+1898-1918+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb093d4310cc71bfd2bd072b4706071651c74b71","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,9,61,67,16,204,113,191,210,189,7,43,71,6,7,22,81,199,75,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
