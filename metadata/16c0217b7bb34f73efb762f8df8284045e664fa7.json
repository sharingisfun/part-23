These shouldn't appear anymore and are deleted when loading old saves.\nCrash with smelt jobs where the item was no longer available\nGeneral Kingdom Worth calculation fixes\nItems not reducing Kingdom Worth if a goblin dropped it, picked it back up and then left the map\nItems sometimes adding their value to Kingdom Worth a second time when a gnome dies\nGENERAL:\nAdjusted enemy spawn strength formula such that slightly higher Kingdom Worth is needed for each stage\nAdjusted gnomad formula so that more gnomads arrive earlier and less later\nAutomatically generate crafting jobs\nReduced mant worker spawns by 20%\nReorder tabs in workshop UI to be consistent with other UI. Default tab is still the crafting tab.\n\nNote: \nYou must have XNA installed to play this.\nYou can find it easilly by googling it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:16c0217b7bb34f73efb762f8df8284045e664fa7","amp;dn":"Gnomoria+0.8.31","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"16c0217b7bb34f73efb762f8df8284045e664fa7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,192,33,123,123,179,79,115,239,183,98,248,223,130,132,4,94,102,79,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
