Murderous scriptwriter \nStanley Caldwell (Judd Nelson) is missing and thought to be dead, \nbut the strange stories of his grisly crimes have made the project \nhe was writing at the time of his death a hot property, and director \nMike Helton (Brian Krause) has hired writer Allison Gaddis \n(Dahlia Salem) to polish Caldwell&amp;#039;s rough draft as he prepares to \nbring Stanley&amp;#039;s final work to the big screen. But it turns out \nStanley isn&amp;#039;t dead after all -- he managed to escape and has gone \ninto hiding, but the news that his work is being tampered with \nbrings him back to the scene of his crimes. Posing as J.C. Reddick, \na relative of the producer, Caldwell gets hired as an assistant \ndirector on the film, and claiming to have known the late Caldwell, \nhe sets out to reshape the movie so that it reflects his own twisted \nideals. Produced for the USA cable network, Return to Cabin by the \nLake was first aired on December 15, 2001. ~ Mark Deming, \nAll Movie Guide \n\n\n\n\nAvi Info\nFile Name ..........: Return.to.Cabin.by.the.Lake.2001.ReComp.avi\nTotal Size (Bytes) .: 733 314 588 Bytes\nTotal Size (KB) ....: 716 128 KB\nTotal Size (MB) ....: 699,34 MB\nTotal Streams ......: 2 Stream(s)\nFile Size Correct ..: Yes\n\nVideo Size (Bytes) .: 647 630 128 Bytes\nVideo Size (KB) ....: 632 451 KB\nVideo Size (MB) ....: 617,63 MB\nVideo Length .......: 01:28:48\nVideo Codec Code ...: XVID\nVideo Codec Name ...: XviD MPEG-4 codec\nVideo Bitrate ......: 972 KB/s\nResolution .........: 560 x 384\nAspect Ratio .......: 1.45:1\nTotal Frames .......: 133197 Frames\nFramerate ..........: 25 FPS\nColor Depth ........: 12 Bits\nQuality Factor .....: 0,180 B/px\nPacked Bitstream ...: Yes\n\nAudio Size (Bytes) .: 85 674 240 Bytes\nAudio Size (KB) ....: 83 666 KB\nAudio Size (MB) ....: 81,71 MB\nAudio Length .......: 01:28:48\nAudio Codec Code ...: 85 (0x0055)\nAudio Codec Name ...: MPEG-1 Layer 3 (MP3)\nAudio Bitrate ......: 128 KB/s (VBR)\nChannels ...........: 2 Ch\nSampling Rate ......: 48000 Hz\n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:168e959e081e3e0ab1da92373802d861111fd877","amp;dn":"Return.to.Cabin.by.the.Lake.2001.ReComp%28SweSub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"168e959e081e3e0ab1da92373802d861111fd877","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,142,149,158,8,30,62,10,177,218,146,55,56,2,216,97,17,31,216,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
