Remastered by\nJames Guthrie at Das Boot Recording\n\nThe title of Pink Floyd's debut album is taken from a chapter in\nSyd Barrett's favorite children's book, The Wind in the Willows\nand the lyrical imagery of The Piper at the Gates of Dawn is\nindeed full of colorful, childlike, distinctly British whimsy\nalbeit filtered through the perceptive lens of LSD. Barrett's\ncatchy, melodic acid pop songs are balanced with longer, more\nexperimental pieces showcasing the group's instrumental\nfreak-outs, often using themes of space travel as metaphors for\nhallucinogenic experiences -- &quot;Astronomy Domine&quot; is a poppier\nnumber in this vein, but tracks like &quot;Interstellar Overdrive&quot; are\nsome of the earliest forays into what has been tagged space rock\nBut even though Barrett's lyrics and melodies are mostly playful\nand humorous, the band's music doesn't always bear out those\nsentiments -- in addition to Rick Wright's eerie organ work\ndissonance, chromaticism, weird noises, and vocal sound effects\nare all employed at various instances, giving the impression of\nchaos and confusion lurking beneath the bright surface. The Piper\nat the Gates of Dawn successfully captures both sides of\npsychedelic experimentation -- the pleasures of expanding one's\nmind and perception, and an underlying threat of mental disorder\nand even lunacy; this duality makes Piper all the more compelling\nin light of Barrett's subsequent breakdown, and ranks it as one\nof the best psychedelic albums of all time\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a7e75e4334027fe6e4f12f9367bf1c662396c81","amp;dn":"Pink_Floyd-The_Piper_At_The_Gates_of_Dawn-Remastered-2CD-FLAC-20","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a7e75e4334027fe6e4f12f9367bf1c662396c81","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,126,117,228,51,64,39,254,110,79,18,249,54,123,241,198,98,57,108,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
