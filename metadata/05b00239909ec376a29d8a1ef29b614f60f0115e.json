It was released as the second single from her third studio album of the same name on July 23, 2010 through digital distribution. Perry and Bonnie McKee wrote many songs with a youthful theme in mind, but they were rejected by producers Benny Blanco and Dr. Luke. Blanco showed them The Teenagers' single &quot;Homecoming&quot;, and McKee imagined &quot;Teenage Dream&quot; as a throwback song to the euphoric feelings of being in love as a teenager. They met with Max Martin in Perry's hometown of Santa Barbara, California and started writing the track at Playback Recording Studio, which Perry later described as a pure moment for her. After Perry recorded her vocals, McKee presented her idea and the chorus was rewritten. Perry also described the song as reminiscent of her youth while contemplating her future marriage to boyfriend Russell Brand.The music video for &quot;Teenage Dream&quot; was filmed in Santa Barbara, California, in July 2010, and was directed by Yoann Lemoine.Perry planned the concept along with the songwriters during the sessions. The video features images of Perry in a car with a boyfriend, then, Perry is shown in a Party with her friends, and the closing scene shows Perry kissing her boyfriend under the water. Perry was interviewed online via YouTube, where she talked about the music video. She said: &quot;It is gonna be completely different from 'California Gurls.' With 'Teenage Dream' you'll see a very raw, almost vulnerable [side] ... I had to wear so many less layers of makeup. I had to make out with a boy which was very traumatizing, I was kind of mean to him. I would be the one to call cut because I was like, 'oh I can't do this!' I feel so horrible. But I know it's a job. [Russell and I] understand what our work is.\n\nMEDIA INFO\n\nVIDEO\n\nID                                       : 1\nFormat                                   : AVC\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile                           : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;8cc4e5ebe4ccc0b9a2bc&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nFormat settings, CABAC                   : Yes\nFormat settings, ReFrames                : 6 frames\nCodec ID                                 : V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\nDuration                                 : 3mn 49s\nNominal bit rate                         : 1 800 Kbps\nWidth                                    : 1 918 pixels\nHeight                                   : 1 074 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 16:9\nFrame rate mode                          : Constant\nFrame rate                               : 23.976 fps\nColor space                              : YUV\nChroma subsampling                       : 4:2:0\nBit depth                                : 8 bits\nScan type                                : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)                       : 0.036\nWriting library                          : x264 core 120\nLanguage                                 : English\nDefault                                  : Yes\nForced                                   : No\nColor primaries                          : BT.709\nTransfer characteristics                 : BT.709\nMatrix coefficients                      : BT.709\n\nAUDIO\n\nID                                       : 2\nFormat                                   : AAC\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat profile                           : LC\nCodec ID                                 : A_AAC\nDuration                                 : 3mn 49s\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nChannel positions                        : Front: L R\nSampling rate                            : 44.1 KHz\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\nDefault                                  : Yes\nForced                      \n\nTHUMBNAILS\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://cdn.piczend.com/images/iubntt97/1378391019_thumbnails.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://cdn.piczend.com/images/iubntt97/1378391019_thumbnails.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nNotes:\n\n* Recommended to use latest version VLC Media Player.\n* Install shark007 codecs in case of any kind of problem in playback (For non-VLC Media Player users).\n* Alternatively, install Core AVC codecs, the fastest decoder that there is coupled with Community Center Codec Pack and play on Windows Media Player Classic.\n\nEncoder Notes: Looking For Early Access To Anything You Can Provide DVDScr, R5, DVDRips, BluRay, Direct Audio, Early Music\nReleases, Seedboxes, Links, Dedicated Servers anything u can provide, Advance / Promo CDs/DVDs.
