It features the liberation struggles of the ANC, negotiations between the National Party and Mandela/ANC before and after Mandela's prison release, battles between the ANC and Zulu fighters who were organized and trained through a Third Force of National Party/ secret police agents, and ultimately the alliance between the ANC and National Party against the extreme alliance of white and black social reactionaries (AWB and Terre Blanche, IFP and Bop/Tribal State governments). Despite an intensely complex situation rife with violence, hate, and division, Mandela's upstanding moral character and brilliance shine through consistently - never does he sink towards revenge, small mindedness or lose his connection towards compassion and an understanding of the greater society. He maintains a &quot;highest, best&quot; mindset emphasizing a peaceful transition towards a multi-racial, democratic, inclusive society, despite being under the most trying of circumstances - upholding not only principled ideals but undertaking the necessary practical measures to achieve success based on the complex realities - something that today's activists can learn from","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ea54e37fe420d72cb08fa3373d9efb91076ae00","amp;dn":"Mandela%27s+Fight+for+Freedom+%28Palestinian+Template%29+Discovery","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ea54e37fe420d72cb08fa3373d9efb91076ae00","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,165,78,55,254,66,13,114,203,8,250,51,115,217,239,185,16,118,174,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
