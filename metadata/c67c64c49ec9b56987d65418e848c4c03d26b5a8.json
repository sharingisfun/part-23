However, although the stylistic differences might give you the illusion of real value, these movies are basically as empty as their Hollywood counterparts: no message, no catharsis. Just pure entertainment, albeit for a different audience: instead of teenagers drinking coke in McDonalds looking for action and special visual effects, it is more for university students drinking green tea in a tea-house, looking for the aforementioned stylistic elements.\n\nSo, this is the field where this movie tries to make an impression. And it succeeds, mostly. There is an excellent start and some interesting characters (a lonely, shy and quite weird anatomist and his wannabe girlfriend). There is a relatively good story with some unexpected twists (experienced viewer may guess them, though). And finally, there is the obligatory &quot;artistic&quot; element, this time taken from Woody Allen (at least I saw similar ideas in his movies): in some points the movie gets surreal by showing the main character's thoughts and dreams: these are probably the best parts of the film. Of course this is not a perfect movie, there are a few inconsistencies in the script, but in summary it is an enjoyable piece. That is, if you like the genre. \n(from IMDB)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c67c64c49ec9b56987d65418e848c4c03d26b5a8","amp;dn":"A+nyomoz%C3%83%C2%B3+AKA+The+Investigator+%282008%29+DVDRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c67c64c49ec9b56987d65418e848c4c03d26b5a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,124,100,196,158,201,181,105,135,214,84,24,232,72,196,192,61,38,181,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
