Del&amp;#039;s on the up and up - into the exciting world of red braces and yuppy shirts. Meanwhile Rodney&amp;#039;s pulled a classy new girlfriend called Cassandra. But what will she think of Nelson Mandella house?\n\nDanger UXD:\n\nJust faking a signature on a delivery note means that Del can take possession of 50 dolls for absolutely nothing. The only problem is that &quot;Lusty Linda&quot; and &quot;erotic Etelle&quot; are not exactly what he had in mind.\n\nChain Gang:\n\nThe opportunity to buy 250 18ct gold chains from a retired jeweller, Arnie, is something Del can&amp;#039;t resist. Everything is fine until Arnie is taken seriously ill just as the deal is about to be sealed and Del is left feeling all that glitters...\n\nThe Unlucky Winner Is:\n\nRodney has won a holiday for 3 in the mediterranean, courtesy of Del and the Megafakes drawing competition. The only snag is he&amp;#039;s got to pretend to be 14 years old all week.\n\nSickness and Wealth:\n\nExcruciating stomach cramps and a constant diet of health salts might drive some people to visit a doctor, but not Del. Oh no, he&amp;#039;s only suffering from that scourge of all serious yuppies, PMA. (Positive Mental Attitude!)\n\nLittle Problem:\n\nWith his diploma in computor science, new job in Cassandra&amp;#039;s father&amp;#039;s firm and impending marriage, Rodney&amp;#039;s certainly on the up. But meanwhile, Del&amp;#039;s got himself into a bit of bother over some hooky mobile phones with the less than understanding Dricoll brothers!\n\nEnjoy!\n\nPlease Seed!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a34d9a535f55c28b508a68fd6be0106b3669b8d0","amp;dn":"Only.Fools.And.Horses.Complete.Series6","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a34d9a535f55c28b508a68fd6be0106b3669b8d0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,77,154,83,95,85,194,139,80,138,104,253,107,224,16,107,54,105,184,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
