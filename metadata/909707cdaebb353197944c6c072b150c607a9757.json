Granger's new method of getting track information to the bookies makes him invaluable to Walters. He threatens to cut Walters off unless he is made a 20% partner. Walters gives in. When Walters tries to collect from a bookie who owes him, the bookie kills first Walters, then himself. Granger takes control of the wire service, making him a target for Lieutenant Wright (Howard St. John) of the Los Angeles Police.\n\nEast Coast mobster Larry Mason (Don Porter) is sent by boss Karl Stevens (Otto Kruger) to persuade Granger to join the Syndicate. He travels west with his wife Gail (Joanne Dru). Granger decides to accept a 50/50 split with his new partners. Some of the independent bookies do not like the new arrangement (and the extra 20% &quot;protection&quot; fee) and refuse to go along. They are roughed up by Syndicate goons.\n\nLater, Trudy returns to work for Granger; she finds out he is being shortchanged. When he complains, he is told that the shortfall is due to &quot;necessary expenses&quot;. He vows to get his money.\n\nGranger and Gail are strongly attracted to each other. They begin seeing each other. When Mason beats Gail, Granger hires a hitman named Gizzi (Robert Osterloh) to kill Mason. Afterward, Gizzi decides to blackmail him. Granger agrees to pay him $25,000 to visit the &quot;old country&quot;, but at the rendezvous at the famous Malibu Pier, Gizzi announces he intends to become Granger's silent partner. Granger crushes him to death against the railing with his car.\n\nUsing his telephone know-how, Granger places a call to Wright that makes it appear he is in Palm Springs and has an alibi. However, Wright tapes the call, and hears a streetcar whistle; there are no streetcars in Palm Springs. The police eventually match the paint from Granger's damaged car to Gizzi's murder.\n\nIn the meantime, Granger decides to retire to Guatemala with Gail. But first, he sets out to collect what is owed to him. With Gail and Chippie's help, he taps into the telephone line to a mob betting parlor in Las Vegas and pulls off a pass-post swindle: intercepting and taping race results to be replayed after a two-minute delay, which gives Gail and Chippie time to place substantial bets. Chippie, however, is recognized by a man who bears a grudge against Granger. One of the bookies who held out, he was beaten up and driven out of business. When he asked Granger to let him join the organization, Granger brushed him off. He tells Stevens what he knows. Stevens then has Chippie brought to him; a matchbook from the Boulder Inn is found in his pocket. Stevens passes the information along to Wright, content to let the police rid him of a troublesome colleague.\n\nWith the police closing in, Granger and Gail flee to Boulder Dam, trying to cross state lines to get out of Wright's jurisdiction, but there is a roadblock there. They join a tour group and descend into the dam. However, Granger is killed before he can find his way to the Arizona side.\n\nCRITAL RESPONSE:-\nWhen the film was first released, The New York Times film critic Bosley Crowther panned the film, writing, &quot;Despite some considerable advertising of 711 Ocean Drive as a daring and courageous revelation of the big bookmaking and gambling syndicates, this modest Columbia melodrama, which came to the Paramount yesterday, is no more than an average crime picture with some colorful but vague details thrown in. Certainly no one who reads the papers with a fairly retentive eye can have any less comprehension of the gambling racket than is illustrated here...In short, this little picture, conventionally written but well photographed, does no more than any gangster picture in reminding us that gangsters are crooks.&quot;\n\nHowever, the staff at Variety magazine wrote well of the film: &quot;Operations of the syndicates are given a realistic touch by the screenplay, and Joseph M. Newman's direction keeps action at a fast pace. O'Brien is excellent as the hot-tempered, ambitious young syndicate chief.&quot;\n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:-\nVideo Codec: MPEG-2\nVideo Bitrate: 4514 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 720x480\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 23.976\nAudio Codec:  AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 448kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 6\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime: 102 mins\nSubtitles: NONE\nRipped by: Trinidad [DDR]   \nDuration: 102 mins","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:909707cdaebb353197944c6c072b150c607a9757","amp;dn":"711+Ocean+Drive+%281950%29+DVD5+-+Edmond+O%27Brien%2C+Joanne+Dru+%5BDDR%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"909707cdaebb353197944c6c072b150c607a9757","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,151,7,205,174,187,53,49,151,148,76,108,7,43,21,12,96,122,151,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
