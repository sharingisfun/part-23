The album was commercially successful, and included the hit single &quot;Hey Man, Nice Shot&quot;. The song was somewhat controversial, as it was seen as capitalizing on the public suicide of Budd Dwyer.[1] Kurt Cobain's suicide was widely rumored to have inspired the song, but the band refuted this. [2] In need of a live band to tour the album, Patrick and Liesegang recruited Geno Lenardo on guitar, Frank Cavanagh on bass, and Matt Walker on drums. They would all later be featured in the video for the album's second single, &quot;Dose&quot;.\n\nBetween Filter's first and second albums, the band became known for their soundtrack contributions, which many fans on the Filter messageboards have dubbed &quot;The Soundtrack EP&quot;. The first of these tracks, &quot;Thanks Bro&quot;, landed on the Songs In The Key Of X: Music From And Inspired By The X-Files album. Patrick is a fan of the show, and furthermore, his brother, Robert Patrick (of Terminator 2 fame, who can be seen wearing a leather jacket with a Nine Inch Nails pin in several interviews for that movie), even went on to star in the show as John Doggett in its later seasons.\n\nIn 1996, Filter recorded and filmed the video for the song &quot;Jurassitol&quot;, for The Crow: City of Angels soundtrack. They also released the home video Phenomenology in 1996, which showcased some of the band's live performances and music videos, as well as an interview with Patrick and Liesegang filmed in New Mexico.\n\nLiesegang left in 1997 shortly after recording the Filter/The Crystal Method collaboration &quot;(Can't You) Trip Like I Do&quot; for the Spawn movie soundtrack, due to creative differences with Patrick. In 1998, for The X-Files film soundtrack, Patrick decided to keep the Filter name and recorded a cover of Harry Nilsson's &quot;One&quot;.\n\nPatrick continued with 1999's Title of Record with returning members Lenardo and Cavanagh, as well as Steve Gillis on drums,[3] filling in the gap left by Walker after he left to work with The Smashing Pumpkins. Title of Record moved away from industrial rock somewhat, and resulted in the band's biggest hit, the mellow ballad &quot;Take a Picture&quot;, along with other lesser-heard singles &quot;Welcome to the Fold&quot; and &quot;The Best Things&quot;. The diverse assortment of tracks on the album also had some definite backstory as well. The song &quot;Take a Picture&quot; is about a dispute on an aircraft, when Richard Patrick drunkenly stripped down to his boxers, alarming the other passengers.[4] Lyrics include: &quot;I don't believe in...your privacy&quot;; &quot;I feel like a new-born&quot;; and &quot;Awake on my airplane.&quot; &quot;Could you take my picture 'cause I won't remember?&quot; is a popular Southern phrase and in this case possibly refers to an alcoholic blackout. The lyrics &quot;Hey, Dad, what do you think about your son now?&quot; refers to the theory that Patrick's father didn't believe he could make it in the recording business and tried to persuade him to pursue another direction. The song &quot;Captain Bligh&quot; (after Vice-Admiral William Bligh of the HMS Bounty) was written by Patrick after leaving Nine Inch Nails and was about Trent Reznor's notoriously anti-social habits.[citation needed] &quot;Miss Blue&quot; is said to have been about Smashing Pumpkins bassist D'arcy Wretzky. She can be heard on the songs &quot;Cancer&quot;, and &quot;Take A Picture&quot;.\n\n\n\nShort Bus \n\n\nShort Bus is the debut album from Filter.
