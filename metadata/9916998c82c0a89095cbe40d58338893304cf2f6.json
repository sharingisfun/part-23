Gale - On the Nature and Existence of God\n\nThere has been in recent years a plethora of defenses of theism from analytical philosophers: Richard Gale's important book is a critical response to these writings. New versions of cosmological, ontological, and religious experience arguments are critically evaluated, along with pragmatic arguments to justify faith on the grounds of its prudential or moral benefits. In considering arguments for and against the existence of God, Gale is able to clarify many important philosophical concepts including exploration, time, free will, personhood, actuality, and the objectivity of experience.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9916998c82c0a89095cbe40d58338893304cf2f6","amp;dn":"Richard+M.+Gale+-+On+the+Nature+and+Existence+of+God","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9916998c82c0a89095cbe40d58338893304cf2f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,22,153,140,130,192,168,144,149,203,228,13,88,51,136,147,48,76,242,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
