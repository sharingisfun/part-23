It sounds like it is clipping on some parts.  A little popping and buzzing.  This is the best I can do, though.  I've long lost my original CD for this abum.\n\nSound quality on Prior to the Fire is EXCELLENT.\n\nIf you enjoy, please buy their merch and go to a show.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb00df67ab494f80c64909737767c8e284a11c50","amp;dn":"Priestess+Discography","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb00df67ab494f80c64909737767c8e284a11c50","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,0,223,103,171,73,79,128,198,73,9,115,119,103,200,226,132,161,28,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
