The sequencing, though out of chronological order, is quite clever and musical. Someone who has never heard Montgomery before will be drawn in most enticingly with Wes' brief yet unforgettably catchy hit with Oliver Nelson, &quot;Goin' Out of My Head.&quot; That is followed by the burnin' &quot;Impressions&quot; with the Wynton Kelly Trio live at the Half Note, which in turn gives way to a luscious Bumpin' outtake with strings, &quot;My One and Only Love,&quot; the Latin-grooving &quot;Tequila&quot;...and the sequence rolls on smoothly and with considerable diversity from there. There are omissions -- nothing from the two albums with Jimmy Smith, nothing from the A&amp;M catalog (which Verve's parent corporation PolyGram owns and could have easily drawn from). But one can still get an idea of how Wes's awesome technical facilities and magical melodic touch dazzled the musicians and wooed the general public of his time. If you don't watch yourself, buying this CD might lead to a full-blown Wes addiction. ~ Richard S. Ginell, All Music Guide \n\nThis bargain collection is an excellent introduction to the work of jazz guitarist Wes Montgomery. it is not, however, a CD for purists. Montgomery is not afraid of pop, of lush strings, of Burt Bacharach covers, of the kind of Big Band kitsch you'd find in the 'Sound Gallery'. Neither am I, and there are some marvellous things here: the melodic breeze of 'Goin' out of my mind'; the aching melancholy of 'My one and only love'; the sublime theme and variations of 'What the world needs now'; the rigorous jam of 'No blues'; the 60s spy film-like excess of 'Caravan'. Like the Hemingway hero, whatever style is offered as musical backdrop, Montgomery's guitar exists in a mellow world of its own, exuding grace under pressure. ~ darrage o'donoghue\n\nVerve Jazz Masters 14 - Wes Montomery Tracks:\n01  GoinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Out Of My Head 2:15 \n02  Impressions 5:05\n03  My One And Only Love 4:08 \n04  Tequila 3:23 \n05  BumpinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ 6:46\n06  What The World Needs Now Is Love 5:00 \n07  No Blues 12:57 \n08  The Shadow Of Your Smile 2:19\n09  Caravan 2:38 \n10  BumpinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ On Sunset 4:52 \n11  Twisted Blues 4:16 \n12  Oh!
