Led by singer Charlie Harper (who previously fronted a R&amp;B outfit called the Marauders), the U.K. Subs formed in November of 1976, after Harper discovered the Damned. Originally called the Subversives before shortening their name, Harper recruited guitarist Nicky Garratt, bassist Steve Slack, and a revolving door of drummers (eventually finding a semi-permanent member with Pete Davis), and soon after began plotting their plan of attack from Harper's place of business, a hairdressing salon in South London. Around this time, the up-and-coming group recorded a live set at the infamous punk club the Roxy (just prior to its closing), with hopes of the recording being issued as their debut album. Although the recording did indeed go down, the tapes sat on a shelf for several years, before eventually being issued in 1980 under the title of Live Kicks. This led to several John Peel sessions on BBC Radio One in 1977 and 1978, and eventually, a recording contract with the GEM record label, and what's often considered to be their finest recording, their 1979 full-length debut, Another Kind of Blues.\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tPunk\t\t\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\n01.Creation\n02.Tokyo Rose\n03.Hell Is Other People\n04.The Axe\n05.Radio Unfriendly\n06.This Chaos\n07.Guru\n08.Eighteen Wheels\n09.Children Of The Flood\n10.All Blurs Into One\n11.Blood\n12.Rock 'N' Roll Whore\n13.Strychnine\n14.Robot Age\n\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e50d9f4950c1737edb183427502126e1152232ed","amp;dn":"U.K.+Subs+-+Work+In+Progress+ADVANCE+%282011%29+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e50d9f4950c1737edb183427502126e1152232ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,13,159,73,80,193,115,126,219,24,52,39,80,33,38,225,21,34,50,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
