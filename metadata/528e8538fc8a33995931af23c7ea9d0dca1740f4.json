The child actors are native speakers, but several adult actors had to learn Dari. Filming wrapped up on December 21, 2006, and the movie was expected to be released on November 2, 2007. However, after concern of the safety of the young actors in the film, its release date was pushed back six weeks to December 14, 2007. [2]\n\nThe plot of the movie follows that of the novel. It tells the story of Amir, a well-to-do boy from the Wazir Akbar Khan district of Kabul, who is haunted by the guilt of betraying his childhood friend Hassan, the son of his father&amp;#039;s Hazara servant. The story is set against a backdrop of tumultuous events, from the fall of the monarchy in Afghanistan through the Soviet invasion, the mass exodus of refugees to Pakistan and the United States, and the Taliban regime.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:528e8538fc8a33995931af23c7ea9d0dca1740f4","amp;dn":"KITE+RUNNER+-+%5BENG%5D%5B2007%5D+-+LIBRE+%26+VERITAS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"528e8538fc8a33995931af23c7ea9d0dca1740f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,142,133,56,252,138,51,153,89,49,175,35,199,234,157,13,202,23,64,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
