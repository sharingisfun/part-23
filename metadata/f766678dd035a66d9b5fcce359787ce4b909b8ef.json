Things take an even darker turn when Roman wakes believing that he is Ryan. As Jess tries to deal with these increasingly disturbing events, she also struggles with the possibility that either the spirit of her husband has returned to her or that something very sinister is at work. This movie embodies the possibility that human possession is possible, and it can happen when you least expect it.\n\nThe film is based on the 2002 South Korean film Addicted.\n\nIMDb RATING: 8.5/10 (228 votes) http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0368563/\n\nRuntime........: 86 mins\nVideo Bitrate..: 970 kbps\nAspect Ratio...: 2.35:1\nResolution.....: 640 x 272\nFrame Rate.....: 23.976 fps\nAudio Bitrate..: 122 kbps MP3 VBR Stereo\nAudio Language.: English\n\ncredit VoMiT &amp; to all the people who made it possible for me to share this with everyone\n\nUPLOAD DEDICATED TO redchaos2354, Motley Crue, jdpennington, BADASS, W1ck3d1nt3ntz, ceo54, DaRkReAlM, ghostman, karakurachow, megaplay, Emery1337x, SaM, geordieboy1979, timamirrockdude, Noir, Shedevil, bone111, JorgeMontana, BlueLady &amp; many, many more &amp; to all the awesome people who are sharing (ALL THE UPLOADERS, THE RIPPERS, THE SCENE GROUPS, ETC, THE WHOLE P2P COMMUNITY)***wish i could list everyone***Thank you very much everyone &amp; i mean EVERYONE!!!\n\n*****help what we can with haiti...the world is ONE big family*****","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f766678dd035a66d9b5fcce359787ce4b909b8ef","amp;dn":"Possession.2009.DVDRip.XviD-VoMiT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f766678dd035a66d9b5fcce359787ce4b909b8ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,102,103,141,208,53,166,109,155,95,204,227,89,120,124,228,185,9,184,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
