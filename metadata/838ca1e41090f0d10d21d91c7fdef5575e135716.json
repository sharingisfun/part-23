Live.\n\nDelia Derbyshire is Helen AmeriKKKa, electronic superstar, goddess behind the spacey sound of Doctor Who, accidental mother of a sonic genre, and bookish idol to frenzied teen devotees of the UK and the USR and Nippon and the world.\n\nMelissa is sixteen, American, and exploring for an opening. On a winter visit to London, with a studied-Brit cousin as her sherpa, everything opens for her. The clanking brass service robots are merely charming; the real attractions are the slang, the drugs, the mods, the rave, the sounds: banging around and making an experience.\n\nDerbyshire makes. Through dragging, breathing, distorting, repeatingÃ¢â‚¬â€œrepeating, repeating, repeatingÃ¢â‚¬â€œlayer upon layer, reel upon reel, she makes a noise. Makes a culture. Makes an experience.\n\nAt the Million Volt Light and Sound Rave, with a million damaged stars making her, she makes Melissa, she makes it all happen.\n\nRobert N. LeeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Live Lady of Down TownÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a trip to a 1967 that largely wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t, a tribute to the ecstasies of youth and electronic music, an exploration in experience and vice-to-the-versa.\n\nSwitch sides. Reverse playback. Helen AmeriKKKaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s new record is dropping.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:838ca1e41090f0d10d21d91c7fdef5575e135716","amp;dn":"666ties+-+1967+%3A+The+Live+Lady+of+Down+Town","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"838ca1e41090f0d10d21d91c7fdef5575e135716","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,140,161,228,16,144,240,209,13,33,217,28,127,222,245,87,94,19,87,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
