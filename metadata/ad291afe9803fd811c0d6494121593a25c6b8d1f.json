They exist in many forms, fulfill many roles, and each have their own behavioral nuances and peculiarities. To date, there exists no comprehensive reference surveying the broad spectrum of electric relays, save one-Electric Relays: Principles and Applications. This ambitious work is not only unique in its scope, but also in its practical approach that focuses on the operational and functional aspects rather than on theory and mathematics.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ad291afe9803fd811c0d6494121593a25c6b8d1f","amp;dn":"Electric+Relays+-+Principles+and+Applications+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ad291afe9803fd811c0d6494121593a25c6b8d1f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,41,26,254,152,3,253,129,28,13,100,148,18,21,147,162,92,107,141,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
