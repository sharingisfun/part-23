They released only two albums. After their remarkable debut &quot;HyÃƒÂ¶nteisiÃƒÂ¤ Voi Rakastaa (Insects cannot love)&quot; in 1995, they surpassed themselves with the mind-blowing album &quot;Huono Parturi (the crazy barber)&quot;. Their eclectic music is a weird and defiant mixture of crimsonian guitar driven prog, salon music, operatic voice acrobatics, Klezmer influences, folk, jazz and modern pop - always well structured songs with often unexpected stylistic breaks.\nThey sing in their native language, but that doesn't matter at all, since it only emphasizes (at least outside of Finland) their crazy and perplexing music.\n\nTwo albums you should have heard once in your life.\n\n1995 - HyÃƒÂ¶nteisiÃƒÂ¤ Voi Rakastaa\n1997 - Huono Parturi\n\n(With cover resp. booklet and cue-sheet)\n\nmore infos at:\nhttp://www.progarchives.com/artist.asp?id=154","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f5e76e2250d072148644a04b17de49b7b37a60cd","amp;dn":"Hoyry-Kone+-+Two+Albums+%28Finnish+Avant+Prog%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f5e76e2250d072148644a04b17de49b7b37a60cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,231,110,34,80,208,114,20,134,68,160,75,23,222,73,183,179,122,96,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
