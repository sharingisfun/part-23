This is a good non-dancing party background cd of a lot of horror \n\nmovie favorites.\nNext are the the Big Scream CD&amp;#039;s. These 4 are all 1 hour long, stereo mixed sound enviroments. Good for placing at specific points at your haunt. I am missing several of these - if you have them please upload!\nThe other CD&amp;#039;s are various FX CD&amp;#039;s from the halloween bins at various stores.\n\nIf you have any other good halloween music cd&amp;#039;s or FX please upload them so we can all use them at halloween!\n\nI have a slow connection - so please no complaining about how long it&amp;#039;s taking. I will seed it until Halloween at least.\n\nIf you need to contact me or send me money ;) my email is below.\n\n&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;d9bbb6bbbbb6bdb8bab5b6aeb799beb4b8b0b5f7bab6b4&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b8c677c0bf625a2d970b0562c4b42750b9dadb14","amp;dn":"Halloween+Sound+Effects+%26+Songs+-+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b8c677c0bf625a2d970b0562c4b42750b9dadb14","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,198,119,192,191,98,90,45,151,11,5,98,196,180,39,80,185,218,219,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
