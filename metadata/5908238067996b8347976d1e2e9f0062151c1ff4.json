This release 2012 on Analogue Productions/Impulse Hybrid SACD.\n\nReview by Scott Yanow:\nOne of the turning points in the career of John Coltrane came in 1965. The great saxophonist, whose playing was always very explorative and searching, crossed the line into atonality during that year, playing very free improvisations (after stating quick throwaway themes) that were full of passion and fury. This particular studio album has two standards (a stirring &quot;Chim Chim Cheree&quot; and &quot;Nature Boy&quot;) along with two recent Coltrane originals (&quot;Brazilia&quot; and &quot;Song of Praise&quot;). Art Davis plays the second bass on &quot;Nature Boy,&quot; but otherwise this set (a perfect introduction for listeners to Coltrane's last period) features the classic quartet comprised of the leader, pianist McCoy Tyner, bassist Jimmy Garrison, and drummer Elvin Jones.\n\n01.
