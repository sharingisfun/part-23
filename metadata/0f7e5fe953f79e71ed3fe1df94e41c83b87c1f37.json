He's a cyborg-the absolute ultimate alpha male. He takes what he wants and holds what is his. Mira is his now. He takes her aboard his ship and has her branded with his mark. He captured her, owns her, and she will serve his every need.\n\nMira is instantly drawn to Flint, fascinated by his seductive appeal. The sex between them is smoking hot. Until she finds out he is a breeder, contracted to a dozen cyborg women, and she is no more than a possession.\n\nMira won't share her cyborg and she belongs to no one-not even to a man who has captured her heart. She doesn't know if cyborgs feel... anything. Can Flint love her? Mira is determined to find out, no matt","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f7e5fe953f79e71ed3fe1df94e41c83b87c1f37","amp;dn":"BurningUpFlint.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f7e5fe953f79e71ed3fe1df94e41c83b87c1f37","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,126,95,233,83,247,158,113,237,63,225,223,148,228,28,131,184,124,31,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
