ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bullet-hell beat-em-up meets old-school RPG, in an arcadey party-game for up to 4 players.\n\nOne player is the hero, exploring a randomly generated dungeon full of traps and monsters - all controlled by the other players. If you slay the hero you take their place and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s your turn to crawl! Then it's a race to gain enough XP and loot to reach the final battle, where it's all on one as the other players collectively control the hulking final boss!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f051e23b715b6b1ccdf3c5b13fd3addb19ef017d","amp;dn":"Crawl+v0.7","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f051e23b715b6b1ccdf3c5b13fd3addb19ef017d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,81,226,59,113,91,107,28,205,243,197,177,63,211,173,219,25,239,1,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
