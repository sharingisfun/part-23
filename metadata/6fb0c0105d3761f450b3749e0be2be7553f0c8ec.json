He loves telling tall tales and always brags about himself. According to him, he was picked up by a human couple who owns a diner while he was drifting around on an iceberg. \nThough he has lost all contact with his Canadian family, he has discovered a new home in serving the diners' clientele, thanks to the kind couple. His cafÃƒÂ© is an embodiment of his personality. The place is always packed with many regulars, animals and humans, who are drawn by his charismatic magnetism.\n\nRelease date : May 03, 2012\n\nAudio language : Japanese\n\nSubTitle language : English\n\nStatus : Currently Airing\n\nProducers : Studio Pierrot\n\nGenres : Comedy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6fb0c0105d3761f450b3749e0be2be7553f0c8ec","amp;dn":"%5BHorribleSubs%5D+Polar+Bear+Cafe+-+05+%5B1080p%5D.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6fb0c0105d3761f450b3749e0be2be7553f0c8ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,176,192,16,93,55,97,244,80,179,116,158,11,226,190,117,83,240,200,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
