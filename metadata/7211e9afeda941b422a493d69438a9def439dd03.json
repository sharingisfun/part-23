He is famous for his deep understanding of chess and fine endgame technique. Many of his games are milestones in the theory of the Slav Defence, the King's Indian Defence and others. He was twice World junior champion and three times Olympic gold medalist. Dreev played in the match Russia-Rest of the world in 2002, won the World team championships in 1997 and 2005.\nIn his words...\n&quot;I have chosen and commented on 100 games for this book. I have played them in a period of more than 20 years. These games are so different from each other that there will be some to everybody's liking - there are sacrifices, there are quiet moves, there are sharp tactical games as well as tough positional fights. You can also find instructive examples of how to play in the various stages of the game. In general, I have devoted a great attention to the openings and my comments about them are from the point of view of the contemporary theory.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7211e9afeda941b422a493d69438a9def439dd03","amp;dn":"My+One+Hundred+Best+Games","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7211e9afeda941b422a493d69438a9def439dd03","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,17,233,175,237,169,65,180,34,164,147,214,148,56,169,222,244,57,221,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
