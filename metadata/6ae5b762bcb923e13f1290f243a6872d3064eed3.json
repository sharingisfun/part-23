The movie was moderately successful at the time, becoming the top-grossing Canadian film that year and has been a fixture on Canadian television and in college dormrooms ever since.\n\nUnfortunately, this corresponding soundtrack album didn&amp;#039;t fare so well (despite winning the Juno for best comedy album in 1984). It was released on Anthem Records in August, 1983, was only available for a couple of years and has been out of print ever since. It has never been available on CD -- not officially, at least. It includes excerpts from the movie, some new Bob and Doug bits (mostly discussing the movie) as well as the theme song performed by Dave Thomas&amp;#039;s real-life brother Ian.\n\nTrack Listing:\n 1.  This Isn&amp;#039;t Our Second Album (4:08)\n 2.  Welcome To Our Movie / Mutants (3:19)\n 3.  Mutants Of 2051 II (3:27)\n 4.  I Didn&amp;#039;t Do It, You Knob (1:59)\n 5.  Mouse In A Bottle (5:41)\n 6.  Strange Brew (3:43)\n 7.  Behind The Scenes (1:03\n 8.  Shakespeare Horked Our Script (1:59)\n 9.  The Game (2:51)\n 10. I Did It, You Knob (2:01)\n 11. The Chase (3:57)\n 12. I Did It Again, You Knob (1:31)\n 13. The Love Theme (1:40)\n 14. Another Strange Brew (5:26)\n\nThis is my own rip from vinyl and although there&amp;#039;s a few clicks (and a bit of distortion in a few places), it sounds a lot better than the cassette-sourced MP3s that are available on the Internet. Plus it&amp;#039;s lossless (FLAC) and I&amp;#039;ve included disc and case artwork. The LP jacket features Bob and Doug&amp;#039;s own newspaper &quot;The Daily Hoser&quot; (or is it &quot;The Daily Knob&quot;?). This was shrunk down to fit inside the CD case but I&amp;#039;ve included copies of my scans for anyone who wants to print it out at full size.\n\nMore information is available at: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.sctvguide.ca/episodes/as_gwn.htm#Strange_Brew&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.sctvguide.ca/episodes/as_gwn.htm#Strange_Brew&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bobanddoug.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bobanddoug.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ae5b762bcb923e13f1290f243a6872d3064eed3","amp;dn":"Bob+And+Doug+McKenzie+-+Strange+Brew+%28Soundtrack%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ae5b762bcb923e13f1290f243a6872d3064eed3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,229,183,98,188,185,35,225,63,18,144,242,67,166,135,45,48,100,238,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
