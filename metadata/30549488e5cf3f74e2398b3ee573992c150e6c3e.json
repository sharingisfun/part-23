\n           in &quot;Scooby Doo: Music of the Vampire.&quot; It begins when         \n           they take a sing-a-long road trip into bayou country          \n           to attend the &quot;Vampire-Palooza Festival&quot;  an outdoor         \n           fair dedicated to all things Draculian.

Could the vampire be a descendant       \n           of a famous vampire hunter who is trying to sell his          \n           book? Or perhaps hes the local politician, who has           \n           been trying to make his name in the press by attacking        \n           the vampires as downright unwholesome.
