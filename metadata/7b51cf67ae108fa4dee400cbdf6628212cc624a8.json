A. Linebarger) is one of many underappreciated science fiction writers of the 1950s and '60s, and this hefty volume should help reinvigorate his reputation. Editor Mann has gathered all of Smith's published science fiction stories, as well as a rewritten version of &quot;Ward 81-Q&quot; and another piece, &quot;Himself in Anachron&quot; (completed by Genevieve Linebarger, the author's widow), which have never appeared in print before. The vast majority of the tales take place within the framework of a general future history later dubbed the Instrumentality of Mankind saga, whose linked but independent components include Smith's most famous pieces: &quot;Scanners Live in Vain,&quot; &quot;The Ballad of Lost C'mell,&quot; &quot;Alpha Ralpha Boulevard&quot; and &quot;The Game of Rat and Dragon.&quot; This collection reveals Smith as a sophisticated, often poetic writer whose work stood out at a time when science fiction was still searching for its literary voice. The volume need not--indeed, should not--be read at one sitting: sampled like the vintage they are, these stories rank among the finest of their time, but guzzled all at once, they wear thin, and the prose grows less endearing. Nevertheless, it's thrilling to have them all preserved in a durable edition, so that future readers will be able to enjoy Smith's unique talent","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b51cf67ae108fa4dee400cbdf6628212cc624a8","amp;dn":"Cordwainer+Smith+-+The+Rediscovery+of+Man","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b51cf67ae108fa4dee400cbdf6628212cc624a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,81,207,103,174,16,143,164,222,228,0,203,223,102,40,33,44,198,36,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
