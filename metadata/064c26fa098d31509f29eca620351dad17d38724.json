Mount it or burn it then watch it but don't sleep thru it. It is all there with menus ect. This season they include the directors commentary and a few more cheesy bonus features or specials. Season 8 brings alternate language tracks and subtitles and more cheezy bonuses.. I'm trying every few days to upload another DVD.. So far so good. No I take that back, I'm dicken around again.. ;)\nAny problems kindly keep them to yourself or ask someone who can help","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:064c26fa098d31509f29eca620351dad17d38724","amp;dn":"Stargate+SG1+Season+8+Disk+2+of+5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"064c26fa098d31509f29eca620351dad17d38724","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,76,38,250,9,141,49,80,159,41,236,166,32,53,29,173,23,211,135,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
