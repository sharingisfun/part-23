(Lynne, however, can take care of himself.) But when the heirloom that's key to her eligibility is stolen, Rachel faces the impossible task of recovering it from the sprawling layer-cake maze of Anvard Ã¢â‚¬â€ and fast! She's certain wandering family friend Jaeger Ayers would know where to start... but where do you turn when you need to find a &quot;finder&quot;?
