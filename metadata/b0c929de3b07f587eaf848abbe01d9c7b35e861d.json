I was disappointed in her performance as Secretary of State, and I was disappointed in this memoir. Really a slog to get through it. There were good moments, when she wrote about relationships and what it was like to do the job - but most of it was exhausting, as if she went through her daily calendar to recall each conversation and meeting minute-by-minute. Her recollections as National Security Advisor were actually far more interesting. And even though the financial collapse and presidential election of 2008 were not her areas of impact or focus, they were pivotal global events, and her ONE PARAGRAPH devoted to each was surprising, given the extraordinary detail she provided on everything else. \n--Kim\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b0c929de3b07f587eaf848abbe01d9c7b35e861d","amp;dn":"Condoleeza+Rice+-+No+Higher+Honor","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b0c929de3b07f587eaf848abbe01d9c7b35e861d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,201,41,222,59,7,245,135,234,248,72,171,190,1,217,199,179,94,134,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
