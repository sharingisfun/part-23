I. Prilepko. \n\nThe present problem book is meant for high-school students\nwho intend to enter technical colleges. I t contains more than\ntwo thousand problems and examples covering all divisions\nof high-school mathematics.\n\nThe main aim of the book is to help students to revise their\nschool knowledge of mathematics and develop a technique\nin solving a variety of problems.\n\nThe book consists of nine chapters divided into sections,\neach of which deals with a certain theme. The problems on\na definite theme are arranged in the order of increasing\ndifficulty, which makes it possible for a student to gradually\nacquire the necessary techniques and experience in problem\nsolving. Thus, the problems are classified as far as possible.\nMost of the problems were given at the entrance examinations\nin various colleges to the USSR in recent years. All the\nproblems are supplied with answers, and some of them with\nsolutions or instructions. The words &quot;Solution&quot; and &quot;Hint&quot;\nare replaced by the signs A and. respectively. The list of\ndesignations makes the use of the book more convenient.\nAll the contributors to the book have a long experience\nas lecturers at preparatory courses of colleges, as teachers\nat high schools specializing in physics and mathematics and\nas examiners in mathematics.\n\nThis book was translated from the Russian by I. A. Aleksanova. The\n  book was published by first Mir Publishers in 1985.\n\n  All credits to the original uploader.\n\n  DJVU | 4 MB | Pages: 280 | Cover\n\n======================================\n=++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++=\n=+                                  +=\n=+ Released on TPB by mirtitles.org +=\n=+                                  +=\n=++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++=\n======================================\t\n\nTable of Contents\n\nChapter 1.
