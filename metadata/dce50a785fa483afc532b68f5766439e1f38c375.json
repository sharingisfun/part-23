After amassing a collection of quirky folk songs, Blue began touring the Tacoma/Seattle area as a one-man act. Buddy Ross eventually joined him, first as a producer and later as a full-fledged bandmember, bringing with him a stronger emphasis on pop music. Guitarist Brantley Cady and drummer Forrest Mauvais also joined the lineup, and Motopony Ã¢â‚¬â€ now a folksy electro-pop quartet, capable of turning out acoustic ballads and fractured dance songs Ã¢â‚¬â€ released their self-titled studio debut in May 2011.
