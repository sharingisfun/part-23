Wind on the Water surprised many listeners with its heavier rock numbers and its trenchant lyrics about aging and death. Crosby and Nash were in their thirties and approaching middle age, and events in personal lives, such as the death of Crosby's mother (which &quot;Carry Me&quot; was partially written about) also affected their songwriting.\n\nWind on the Water is considered an &quot;adult rock&quot; album by many critics, many of them suggesting that it reflects the more mature outlook of two men who are more traveled and more seasoned than younger performers.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd44362955e654705c9047d7015f7593ebe85fc9","amp;dn":"David+Crosby+and+Graham+Nash+-+Wind+on+the+Water","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd44362955e654705c9047d7015f7593ebe85fc9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,68,54,41,85,230,84,112,92,144,71,215,1,95,117,147,235,232,95,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
