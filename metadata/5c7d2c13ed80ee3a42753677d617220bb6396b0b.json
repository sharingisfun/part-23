Chelsea's London derby against Tottenham is the pick of Wednesday's games as Spurs look to make amends for the 4-0 defeat they suffered at Stamford Bridge last season. Also in the capital, Arsenal take on a Southampton side who had already won at the Emirates this season - a 2-1 League Cup triumph in September. Elsewhere on Wednesday night, Sunderland welcome Manchester City in a repeat of the previous season's League Cup final while Everton entertained Hull. Tuesday's action will also be reviewed with Manchester United's home clash with Stoke and Liverpool's trip to Leicester the pick of the six fixtures.\n\n\nOverall bit rate:  4912 Kbps\nFrame rate         50 Fps\n\ncabac=1 / ref=5 / deblock=1:-3:-3 / me=umh / subme=9 /","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c7d2c13ed80ee3a42753677d617220bb6396b0b","amp;dn":"Match+of+the+Day+2014-12-03+720p+50fps+HDTV+x264-wAm.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c7d2c13ed80ee3a42753677d617220bb6396b0b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,125,44,19,237,128,238,58,66,117,54,119,214,23,34,11,182,57,107,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
