It  \nfeatures Louis Johnson on bass and guest appearances of Lee  \nRitenour on electric guitar.  The album peaked at number 124 on the  \nBillboard 200 chart and reached number 16 on the Jazz chart.\n\nA variety of musicians and composers were involved in the recording  \nand production of the album including some backing music provided by  \nthe Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra.  The album was produced by  \nDave Gruisin and Larry Rosen and engineered by Phil (Boogie)  \nSchier.  Recording sessions were conducted during January and  \nFebruary of 1976 at Kendun Recorders in Burback, California.  Earl  \ndedicated the album to his mother and brother in the liner notes.\n\nEarl Klugh was an early protÃƒÂ©gÃƒÂ© of George Benson and has also  \nplayed for such industry stalwarts as Chick Corea and Stanley Clarke  \nprior to the recording of this eponymous album.  The lineup of songs  \ninclude covers of Neil Sedaka's &quot;Laughter In The Rain&quot; as well as  \nsome original work such as &quot;Angelina&quot;, &quot;Vonetta&quot;, and &quot;Wind and  \nSea&quot;.  The opening song of the album &quot;LasManos De Fuego&quot; displays  \nthe virtuosity of Earl's playing style as his fingers nimbly attack almost  \nevery portion of the guitar fret board at a frantic pace.  This album  firmly \nestablished Earl Klugh as a dynamic player and composer and  was the \nimpetus of a very long career as an innovative jazz guitarist during the \nestablishment of the early smooth jazz fusion era.\n\n\nTrack Listing\n\nSong Title \t\t\t\tTime \t\n1.
