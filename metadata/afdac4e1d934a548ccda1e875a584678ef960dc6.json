Their first ship is destroyed in transit by the giant flying turtle Gamera. A second ship makes it to Earth and captures two Boy Scouts and holds them captive so that Gamera will not attack them. The aliens then implant a remote control device into the monster's neck and use the great turtle to attack Tokyo. The boys then come up with a plan to foul up the remote control device to the point where Gamera does the opposite of what he is ordered to. As a result Gamera destroys the aliens ship, but then has to contend with their giant squid like leader Viras.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:afdac4e1d934a548ccda1e875a584678ef960dc6","amp;dn":"Destroy+All+Planets+%2F+Gamela+vs.+Baivus","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"afdac4e1d934a548ccda1e875a584678ef960dc6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,218,196,225,217,52,165,72,204,218,30,135,90,88,70,120,239,150,13,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
