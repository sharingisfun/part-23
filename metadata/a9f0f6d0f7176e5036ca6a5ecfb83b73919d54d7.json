Yet, there is no objective method of diagnosis for ADHD. And, many of these medications can cause serious side effects including amphetamine psychosis. \nIn The ADD Myth, ADHD coach Martha Burge proposes that what is commonly understood as ADHD is actually five intense personality traits: sensual, psychomotor, intellectual, creative, and emotional. Once properly understood, People with these intense personality traits can develop them into gifts. \nThe ADD Myth shows: \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ The five intense personality traits: sensual, psychomotor, intellectual, creative, and emotional \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Why all personalities exist along a &quot;neurodiversity&quot; spectrum \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Where intense people fit on the spectrum \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Why the medical profession should seek alternative explanations for ADHD \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Stories, practical steps, and daily practices for developing one's intense nature with the least amount of suffering. \nBurge includes her own story of having both of her children diagnosed with ADHD, the serious reactions they had to drug treatment, and how she began her search for an alternative approach to help them. The ADD Myth will raise awareness of the underlying condition of intensity, and help people who previously thought of themselves as broken develop more fulfilling lives.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a9f0f6d0f7176e5036ca6a5ecfb83b73919d54d7","amp;dn":"The+ADD+Myth+by+Martha+Burge","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a9f0f6d0f7176e5036ca6a5ecfb83b73919d54d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,240,246,208,247,23,110,80,54,202,106,94,207,184,59,115,145,157,84,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
