As the\n  Germans closed in on the capital, the fighting got fiercer and more\n  desperate. The delay of the German forces after Smolensk left little time\n  for the drive to Moscow before the onset of winter. And while both German\n  and Russian High Commands were well aware of this, nevertheless, &amp;#039;Operation\n  Typhoon&amp;#039; went ahead as planned. The attack was costly and first bogged down\n  in endless mud, making the roads impassable. Next, the offensive was\n  literally &amp;#039;frozen in its tracks&amp;#039; when the harsh Soviet winter set in.\n  The Germans were not provided with winter clothing, and their vehicles and\n  equipment were similarly not prepared. Yet despite all this, they reached\n  the western suburbs, barely 17 km from the Kremlin, but before they ever\n  encircled the city Soviet reinforcements arrived. Some of these new Russian\n  troops were Siberian divisions, equipped and trained for winter fighting.\n  \n  Can you capture Moscow in the face of the strengthening Red Army and the\n  onset of the bitter Russian Winter?\n\n  Ripped: Intro was lost, frozen to death...\n\n\nIf you like this game, buy it !
