The story was 16 pages, black and white. A planetary lord hired Starbuck to rescue his bride, who had been kidnapped for ransom by a monk of the Sanctuary of St.Berryl, a former leper colony.  He has also appeared in various issues of the graphics magazine Heavy Metal.\n\nStarbuck is the earliest example of a character that later became characteristic of Chaykin's work: a swashbuckling, morally ambivalent, free-wheeling good/bad guy in a decadent, sexually explicit universe, who looks more than a little bit like Chaykin himself.\n\nStarbuck is the darkest of these characters; in early stories he is gleefully venal and treacherous, generally doing good only if the price is right. He can be seen as a more amoral version of Ironwolf, a character previously drawn and plotted by Chaykin for Weird Worlds in 1973. He also resembles Dominic Fortune, created by Chaykin in 1975 for Marvel Comics.\n\nAppearances:\nStar*Reach #1 (1974)\nStar*Reach #4: The Return of Cody Starbuck (1976)\nCody Starbuck one-shot, published by Star*Reach (1978) (in Spanish - hopefully someone can upload the issue in English)\nPortfolio of four full-colour prints, published by S.Q.
