Bestselling author and psychologist Barbara Killinger explores the loss of basic integrity and offers practical techniques for developing and maintaining integrity in a culture that sometimes challenges it. Drawing on her clinical practice and pioneering efforts in workaholism Dr Killinger describes the personality traits and psychological, philosophical, historical, and familial influences that help develop and maintain integrity. She also looks at how integrity is undermined and lost as a result of obsession, narcissism, and workaholism. Richly illustrated with personal stories, Integrity offers a positive &quot;how to&quot; perspective on safeguarding personal and professional integrity and on encouraging our children to develop this vital character trait. Killinger concludes that integrity is not possible without compassion and makes it clear that doing the right thing includes doing it for the right reason.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f53b09fb655f0bc20e6e89ced412dd8d9f9bbe9","amp;dn":"Integrity%3A+Doing+the+Right+Thing+for+the+Right+Reason","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9f53b09fb655f0bc20e6e89ced412dd8d9f9bbe9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,83,176,159,182,85,240,188,32,230,232,156,237,65,45,216,217,249,187,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
