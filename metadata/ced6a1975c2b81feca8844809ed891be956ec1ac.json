Please do me the favor, and read this text regarding any future playlists!\n\nThis will be the last big playlist by me.\n\nFrom now on, any playlists made by me will be smaller sized (mostly around 50 tracks),\nas this year will consume a big amount of my real life time.\n\nNot every future playlist might be finished exactly at the end of a month, \nas this depends on how much free time I'll have. But they will be done =)\n\nReason:\nI'll have a small computer job soon &amp; I can begin my long wanted apprenticeship \nas a caregiver for handicapped people in a few months. \n\nBoth things will be time consuming, so I'm sure you'll understand my situation.\n\nAnother reason is that I'll work on a few small tumblr mixtapes (non related pl. tracks) \nin the future &amp; a few mixtapes that I'll ship to other people.\n\nEverything consumes time, so I gotta make the best out of it!\n\nSmall rant finished.\n\nAnother note:\nI added/tagged myspace &amp; artist links into the commentary section of each track, in case you want\nto know more about a band, look infos up, or SUPPORT them.\n\nThe list is a bit more folkish than my last, but I was just in the mood for that,\nbut there should be something worthy in here for everyone, as there are multiple genres featured.\n\nThanks go out especially to fentiger for this fantastic cover!\n&amp; to everyone who'd send me recommendations.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n VA - Various Artists - daKradha's Indie Rock Playlist - March 2010\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       Tracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n   1.
