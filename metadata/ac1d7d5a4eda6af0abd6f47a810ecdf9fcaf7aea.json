With biting guitars, fuzzy keyboards, melodic choruses, and some of their most intricate turntable work to date, By The Throat cuts right to the vein and advances far beyond Eyedea &amp; Abilities battle tested history (winners of HBO Blaze Battle, Rocksteady, Scribble Jam and the DMC's).\n\nThroughout the nineties the duo played an important role in the development of the emerging underground Hip Hop scene alongside friends Atmosphere, Aesop Rock, EL-P, the Living Legends, Sage Francis, Blueprint and more.
