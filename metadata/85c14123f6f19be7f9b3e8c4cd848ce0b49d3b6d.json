Many retirees or soon-to-be retirees have heard a plethora of advice. Take 100 (or 120) and subtract your age to get your equity allocation, put the rest in bonds or cash. Buy only bonds. Buy only high dividend stocks. Or some combination! Buy equity-indexed annuities or some Ã¢â‚¬Å“guaranteedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ income product. All examples of a potentially harmful myth many folks believe to be smart, strategic moves. \n\nInvestors believe preparing for retirement requires a radically different set of tools or a dizzying array of products. Navigating the world of retirement products and services can be a full-time job. But investing for retirement is, in practice, not much (if at all) different from investing. In Your Retirement Plan, Ken Fisher will give readers a workable strategy to either develop their own retirement investing plan or work more successfully with a professional to increase the likelihood of achieving long-term goals while avoiding common pitfalls. The book will include easy-to-follow steps like \n\nHow to think, correctly, about investing time horizon.\nHow to better figure how much income you need\nHow to determine if a portfolio can provide that income\nHow to figure how much to save each year to achieve retirement goals\nWhat pitfalls to avoid\nAnd more. . . . \nIn this retirement planning book that's not just for retirees, Fisher will hand readers the tools and confidence they need to better plan for the future.\n\nSeries: Fisher Investments\nHardcover: 180 pages\nPublisher: Wiley; 1 edition (October 30, 2012)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1118431065\nISBN-13: 978-1118431061\n\nSee a tiny collection of my torrents.
