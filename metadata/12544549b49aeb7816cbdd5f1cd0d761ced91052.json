Disgruntled employees like Assistant Manager Porky Pig, Marvin Martian, Speedy Gonzales, and Elmer Fudd plead to Daffy Duck for small concessions like a day off on Christmas and discounted toys, but Daffy is relentless in his pursuit of the almighty dollar. It's up to last minute shopper Bugs Bunny; the ghosts of Christmases past (Tweety and Granny), present (Yosemite Sam) and future (Taz); and Porky Pig's young daughter Priscilla to make Daffy see the error of his ways and discover the true meaning of Christmas.\n\nPlease Enjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:12544549b49aeb7816cbdd5f1cd0d761ced91052","amp;dn":"Bah+Humduck%21+a+looney+tunes+Christmas","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"12544549b49aeb7816cbdd5f1cd0d761ced91052","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,84,69,73,180,154,235,120,22,203,221,95,28,208,215,97,206,217,16,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
