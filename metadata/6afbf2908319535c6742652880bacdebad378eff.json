Within a few short decades the most hostile of the\nworldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s environments had all been conquered. Likewise, in\nthe twentieth century, medicine transformed human life.\nDoctors took what was routinely fatal and made it survivable.\nAs modernity brought us ever more into different kinds of\nextremis, doctors pushed the bounds of medical advances\nand human endurance. Extreme exploration challenged the\nbody in ways that only the vanguard of science could answer.\nDoctors, scientists, and explorers all share a defining\ntrait: they push on in the face of grim odds. Because\nof their extreme exploration we not only understand\nour physiology better; we have also made enormous strides\nin the science of healing.\n\nExtreme Medicine: How Exploration Transformed\nMedicine in the Twentieth Century\nBy: Kevin Fong\nISBN13: 9781594204708\nFormat: EPUB\nLanguage: EN\nPages: 509","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6afbf2908319535c6742652880bacdebad378eff","amp;dn":"Extreme+Medicine+by+Kevin+Fong.+EPUB+%28Perseu%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6afbf2908319535c6742652880bacdebad378eff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,251,242,144,131,25,83,92,103,66,101,40,128,186,205,235,173,55,142,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
