Much like the novel, the film borrows certain elements from the Anabasis by Xenophon.\n\nThe Warriors begin their long journey from the Bronx back to Coney Island. The second-in-command, Swan (Michael Beck), takes charge, though the hot-headed Ajax (James Remar) openly voices his desire to be acting gang warlord. The Warriors slowly cross the dangerous Bronx and Manhattan territories, narrowly escaping police and other gangs every step of the way. On their way to the subway, they find another gang, the Turnbull AC's, looking for them. They have no choice but to make a run to the train. The Turnbull AC's almost reach them but the Warriors make it to the train, just in time for the doors to close. However, on the ride back to Coney Island, the train is stopped by a fire on the tracks, dumping the Warriors in the Bronx. In the Bronx, they come across a gang called the Orphans. They convince the Orphans to let them through town peacefully until they come across Mercy (Deborah Van Valkenburgh), a feisty girl who convinces the Orphans to try and put up a fight with the Warriors when they refuse to give her one of their gang-vests. When she challenges the manhood of the Orphans' leader, he, to save face, tells the Warriors to remove their gang colors for safe passage. The Warriors refuse, resulting in a near fight quelled only by the Warriors' use of a Molotov cocktail. Mercy, impressed, follows the Warriors on impulse.\n\n\nDirected by \tWalter Hill\n\nProduced by \tLawrence Gordon\n\nWritten by \tSol Yurick (novel)\n                David Shaber\n                Walter Hill (screenplay)\n\nStarring \tMichael Beck\n                James Remar\n                Dorsey Wright\n                Deborah Van Valkenburgh\n                David Patrick Kelly\n                Edward Sewer\n\nMusic by \tBarry De Vorzon\n                Joe Walsh\n\n\nFormat                           : MPEG-4\nCodec ID                         : mp42\nFile size                        : 700 MiB\nDuration                         : 1h 30mn\nOverall bit rate                 : 1086 Kbps\n\nVideo\nFormat                           : AVC\nFormat/Info                      : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile                   : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;9ad2f3fdf2dad6a9b4ab&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nBit rate mode                    : Variable\nBit rate                         : 923 Kbps\nWidth                            : 720 pixels\nHeight                           : 576 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 16/9\nFrame rate mode                  : Variable\nFrame rate                       : 25.000 fps\nMinimum frame rate               : 24.987 fps\nMaximum frame rate               : 89.054 fps\nStandard                         : PAL\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.089\n\n\nAudio\nFormat                           : AAC\nFormat/Info                      : Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat version                   : Version 4\nFormat profile                   : LC\nBit rate mode                    : Variable\nBit rate                         : 159 Kbps\nMaximum bit rate                 : 235 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nChannel positions                : L R\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nLanguage                         : English\n\n\n\nJacket DVD @600dpi\n\n\nPlayback Problems?-- &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.videolan.org/vlc/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.videolan.org/vlc/&lt;/a&gt;  --It's So Simple!\n\n\nand you're welcome..;)\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d1fbc83d6ec1fde3296b4c15253ee0c16875a55","amp;dn":"The+Warriors+Ultimate+Directors+Cut+1979%5BH.264-MP4%5D%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d1fbc83d6ec1fde3296b4c15253ee0c16875a55","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,31,188,131,214,236,31,222,50,150,180,193,82,83,238,12,22,135,90,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
