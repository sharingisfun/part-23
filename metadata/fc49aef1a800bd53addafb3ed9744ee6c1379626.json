It has been sealed for centuries, and only one man has ever escaped. Finn has always been a prisoner here. Although he has no memory of his childhood, he is sure he came from Outside. His link to the Outside, his chance to break free, is Claudia, the warden's daughter, herself determined to escape an arranged marriage. They are up against impossible odds, but one thing looms above all: Incarceron itself is alive . . .\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nUnfortunately this is just the PDF the only option I had access to. I might put up the ebook if I can.\n\nBrought to you lovingly by Uploader and Transcriber CRUICE*","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc49aef1a800bd53addafb3ed9744ee6c1379626","amp;dn":"Incarceron_PDF_Full_CRUICE%2A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc49aef1a800bd53addafb3ed9744ee6c1379626","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,73,174,241,168,0,189,83,173,218,251,62,217,116,78,230,193,55,150,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
