It chronicles World War I over eight episodes.\n\nEpisode 5: Mutiny\n\nAfter three years of war, men, armies and nations were nearing a breaking point. For individual soldiers, it emerged as &quot;shell shock,&quot; a personal withdrawal from an intolerable reality of trench warfare. For armies, it was outright rebellion; half the French army mutinied in 1917, refusing to undertake senseless attacks. Most of their demands were met, and only a small number of the mutineers were punished severely.\n \nEntire populations were becoming restless and resentful with the conflict. In Russia, both the army and civilian population refused to fight anymore for the Tsar, who abdicated on March 15, 1917. Alexander Kerensky led the fragile democracy that emerged to govern Russia, but made the catastrophic mistake of continuing the war. Recognizing the weakness for the army and the refusal of the men to fight, he authorized women to be trained and sent to the front. \n \nAs Kerensky's offensive failed and army desertions increased, his popularity decreased. Mobilizing anti-war sentiment, Lenin and his Bolsheviks quickly took over, and signed an armistice with Germany.\n\n\nEpisode 6: Collapse\n\nThe odds looked bad for the Allies in 1918. With Russia knocked out of the war by revolution and the French army rocked by mutiny, Germany stopped the Allies' offensive on the Western Front. But all of Europe was running out of men; both sides were drafting old men and young boys. The Kaiser no longer had effective power, with Generals Hindenburg and Ludendorff taking over.\n \nIn 1917, German U-boat attacks and German approaches to Mexico had provoked President Woodrow Wilson [link to the Wilson material on the GW site] into a war he did not want to fight. Once in it, however, he urged the United States to &quot;make the world safe for Democracy&quot; and by 1918, five million American men were in uniform. In September of that year, the Doughboys went over the top and they were cut down like cornstalks. But the presence of American troops in France made a difference; the German army saw it could not win the war; thousands surrendered on the western front. \n \nIn October, the revolt of the German Navy triggered the final collapse of the German war effort. The Kaiser abdicated and fled to Holland. The guns of the Great War finally fell silent on November 11, 1918.\n \nWhen the cease-fire came, people all over the world celebrated. But the war was not over for the German civilians. The Allies insisted on continuing the blockade through the winter months, resulting in mass starvation and death.\n \nIn the days that followed the Armistice, peopled learned that it is often far easier to wage war than it is to build a lasting peace.\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.pbs.org/greatwar/chapters/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.pbs.org/greatwar/chapters/index.html&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:066b57c503c123613fed76d6c864a7397617d0e5","amp;dn":"The+Great+War+and+the+Shaping+of+the+20th+Century_episodes_5_and","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"066b57c503c123613fed76d6c864a7397617d0e5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,107,87,197,3,193,35,97,63,237,118,214,200,100,167,57,118,23,208,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
