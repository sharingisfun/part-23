With the fifth edition this classic has been updated to report on advances in number theory over the last 50 years, including the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem. Deceptively simple in style and structure, it is a book to which the reader will return again and again, gaining greater understanding and satisfaction with each reading.\n\n\n# Paperback: 208 pages\n# Publisher: A K Peters, Ltd.; 5th edition (February 4, 2006)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 1568812736\n# ISBN-13: 978-1568812731","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5652dc102956de42fe7aea1bdc77480c43c79129","amp;dn":"From+Zero+to+Infinity%3A+What+Makes+Numbers+Interesting%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5652dc102956de42fe7aea1bdc77480c43c79129","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,82,220,16,41,86,222,66,254,122,234,27,220,119,72,12,67,199,145,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
