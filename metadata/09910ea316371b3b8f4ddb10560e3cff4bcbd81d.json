Epub and mobi formats.\n\n\nFiles:\n\n\n\nOnce Were Warriors (1990): Once Were Warriors is Alan Duff's harrowing vision of his country's indigenous people two hundred years after the English conquest. In prose that is both raw and compelling, it tells the story of Beth Heke, a Maori woman struggling to keep her family from falling apart, despite the squalor and violence of the housing projects in which they live. Conveying both the rich textures of Maori tradition and the wounds left by its absence, Once Were Warriors is a masterpiece of unblinking realism, irresistible energy, and great sorrow.\n\n\n\nWhat Becomes of the Broken Hearted? (1996): The raw and powerful sequel to Once Were Warriors. It is six years since Jake's daughter Grace hanged herself. Jake's wife, Beth, has left him, his son Nig was killed in a gangland fight - his only consolations are drink and his memories. His daughter Polly is determined to escape the violence that is destroying the Maoris. But can Jake, too, redeem himself?\n\n\n\nJake's Long Shadow (2002): The millennium has changed but have the Hekes? Where are they now, Beth, Jake, and what of their other children? Son Abe who has rejected violence but violence finds him. Polly, as beautiful as her sister Grace, who committed suicide; is that a Heke running with the wealthy polo-playing set and growing rich herself? And the gang leader, Apeman, who killed Tania, what's prison like? Does it change a man, grow him or not? We meet another tragic female figure, Sharneeta. And Alistair Trambert, a middle-class white boy sunk into the same welfare dependency trap as the Maoris his class criticize. Meet Charlie Bennett, Beth's husband, a fine man and yet ... And yet there's Jake Heke, casting his long shadow over everyone. Has he really grown up?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:09910ea316371b3b8f4ddb10560e3cff4bcbd81d","amp;dn":"Once+Were+Warriors+book+trilogy+by+Alan+Duff+%5Bepub%2C+mobi%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"09910ea316371b3b8f4ddb10560e3cff4bcbd81d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,145,14,163,22,55,27,59,143,77,219,16,86,14,60,255,75,203,216,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
