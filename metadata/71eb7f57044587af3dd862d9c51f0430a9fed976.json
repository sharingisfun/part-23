While most comparable texts are primarily directed toward the field of human toxicology, this is the one text needed to thoroughly prepare future veterinarians on the newest approaches for diagnosing poisoning cases in all animals from chemicals and plants of a diverse nature as a result of inadvertent, accidental, or malicious intents. Many chapters are provided on topics not covered in any previous books such as target organ toxicity, radiation and radioactive materials, FDA regulatory issues, and ethics in veterinary toxicology.\n\n    New chapters covering important and timely topics such as melamine and cyanuric acid, toxicogenomics, toxic gases and veterinary medical geology\n    Expanded look at international topics, such as epidemiology of animal poisonings, regulatory guidelines and poisonous plants in Europe\n    Heavily contributed book with chapters written by qualified and well-experienced authorities across all areas of veterinary toxicology\n    Problem solving strategies are offered for treatment as well as in-depth knowledge of the basic mechanisms of veterinary toxicology \n\n\nReview\n\n&quot;A lot of in-depth information in 1 text, including some not readily available elsewhere. A number of topics included are contemporary, which increases its value for toxicologists who are not specifically veterinary toxicologists. There is more extensive coverage of pathology than is typical of toxicology texts.&quot; - Marion Ehrich, PhD, DABT, in Journal of American Veterinary Medical Association.\n&quot;A useful source of information for the veterinary clinician, student, and toxicologist. The strengths of this book comprise the inclusion of large and small animal species; the broad range of topics encompassing regulatory, diagnostic, pathologic, and clinical toxicology; and the affordable cost. A nice addition to any veterinarian's library and is well worth the price.&quot; - The Canadian Veterinary Journal &quot;A unique single reference that teaches the basic principles of veterinary toxicology to any student at the DVM, MS or PhD level and will continue to serve as a clinical reference for practicing veterinary toxicologists, poison control centers, marine biologists, environmentalists, and animal scientists. While most comparable texts are primarily directed toward the field of human toxicology, this is the one text needed to thoroughly prepare future veterinarians on the newest approaches for diagnosing poisoning cases in all animals from chemicals and plants of a diverse nature as a result of inadvertent, accidental, or malicious intents. Many chapters are provided on topics not covered in any previous books such as target organ toxicity, radiation and radioactive materials, FDA regulatory issues, and ethics in veterinary toxicology...many newer topics including chemicals of terrorism, estrogenic toxicants, and nanoparticles are included. Overall, the information provided is well organized and comprehensive...generous and relevant references at the end of each chapter allow the opportunity to further pursue each topic. This book can be considered a cornerstone upon which a deeper understanding of the issues and individual toxicants in veterinary toxicology can be based. The topics covered are of interest to not only toxicologists and researchers, but also to clinicians who do not have an extensive background in toxicology. This book is a fine addition to any veterinary professional's library, but it is important to realize that after becoming familiar with this material, the readers' interests will then determine if more focused, additional resources are needed.&quot; - Paul A. Eubig, DVM, MS, DABT (University of Illinois College of Veterinary Medicine), in DOODY'S REVIEWS.\n\n&quot;The book is reasonably priced, rich and rewarding and I can warmly recommend it as a useful reference book to all practicing toxicologists.&quot; - Roy Forster, CIT, France - The British Toxicology Society Newsletter.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:71eb7f57044587af3dd862d9c51f0430a9fed976","amp;dn":"Veterinary+Toxicology%2C+2nd+Edition%3A+Basic+and+Clinical+Principle","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"71eb7f57044587af3dd862d9c51f0430a9fed976","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,235,127,87,4,69,135,175,61,216,98,217,197,31,4,48,169,254,217,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
