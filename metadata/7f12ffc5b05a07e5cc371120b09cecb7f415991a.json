Program Description\n**********************\n\n\nIn Short:\n=========\n\nYou are getting a Key from someone,you don't know what the Key is for either Office or Windows?,for which edition is the key used for?,what type of key is it either a retail or Volume?,for what version is this Key used for? etc...\nThen this Program is the only solution for all.\n\nIn Brief:\n=========\n\nThe Universal PID Checker allows you to calculate the Product ID of given product key. Key validity will be checked also. The unique feature is reading keys from file and saving log (beta). Performance of PID generation is checked too - time spent on generating will be printed under the result.\n\nFeatures:\n=========\nGenerating PID from typed key/input\n\n*for Windows Vista/Server 2008\n*for Windows 7/Server 20008 R2\n*for Office 2010\n*for all builds &gt;= 6.0.5365.8\n\nGenerating PID from file\nSaving output to log\nViewing system key\n\n\nII. Usage\n*********\n\nfrom clipboard/manual input:\n============================\n\nEnter a 25-digit key (dashes will be added automatically), (if you have it in clipboard, it will be pasted automatically) .\nThe Windows Flag button pastes your current system key into box.\nIf you want to check keys for unsupported beta builds, just select &quot;Custom&quot; and choose pkeyconfig file.\nClick the &quot;Go!&quot; button to start generating PID.\n\nfrom file:\n==========\nClick &quot;Browse&quot; button and choose file with keys. Note that it must be text file containing keys only, one key per one line. Now, file CAN contain spaces.\nSelect a profile (If you want to check keys for unsupported beta builds, just select &quot;Custom&quot; and choose pkeyconfig file).\nYou can choose the Log option to log output to file (recommended).\nClick &quot;Go!&quot; button to start generating.\nYou will get a message when it will be done. Overall time will be shown too.\n\nblacklist:\n==========\n1. Blacklist function lets you check if key is blacklisted by MS.\n2. Put a list of blacklisted keys into txt file, save as blacklist.txt in program  folder.\n3. If the key is on your blacklist, program will tell you. \n\n\nNote: \n=====\nYou can use pkeyconfigs from build 5365.8 of Vista and newer.\n\nIII. System Requirements\n************************\n\nOS: Windows XP/Vista/7/Server 2008/Server 2008 R2\nRAM: 25MB free memory\nCPU: AMD Phenom X2 or Intel Core 2 Duo (~2GHz) for good performance\nHDD: Application uses about 10MB on disk\n\n\nIV.
