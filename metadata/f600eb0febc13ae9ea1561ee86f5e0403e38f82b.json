The group was originally called the Sherabons and was formed in Hackney during November of 1963 by Martin Murray. His day job was managing a hair salon, and when he formed the band, he brought along his assistant, Anne Margot Lantree, who was nicknamed &quot;Honey&quot; and used that on-stage -- she played drums and, with her good looks, was a double attention-getter. Her brother John joined on bass, and Alan Ward played lead guitar. And for a lead vocalist, they had Dennis D'Ell (born Denis Dalziel). Their original name was the Sherabons (some sources list it as the Sheratons) -- something Murray remembers seeing on the side of a van -- and they got a three-times weekly gig at a pub called the Mild May Tavern, on Balls Pond Road in London's East End, where they were lucky enough to be spotted by Alan Blaikley, who was attracted by the crowds of teenagers they drew. Visually, the group was highlighted by Lantree's presence at the drums, her good looks topped by a then-fashionable beehive hairdo. Rhythm guitarist and leader Murray also added to the appealing eccentricity of the band's look with his bespectacled presence -- to see him on the cover of their albums, one would think he was the group's accountant, but what made the picture even better was that he was a great player in his own right. At that time, their music consisted entirely of R&amp;B and rock &amp; roll standards interspersed with instrumentals. Blaikley liked their sound and had a song to offer them -- he and his business partner Ken Howard's had written a composition called &quot;Have I the Right&quot; and were looking for a group to record it, and this East End quintet seemed to fit the bill.  ....\n\nTo read the entire bio: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:a9fqxqw5ldje~T1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:a9fqxqw5ldje~T1&lt;/a&gt;\n\nI was unable to find this album at All Music or Amazon.com.\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
