Bergdahl trade as Republicans accuse Obama of negotiating with terrorists and the suspiciously timed story overshadows the VA scandal. \n\nAlex also covers some of the biggest revelations of this year's explosive Bilderberg meeting in Copenhagen Denmark. The annual meeting of renowned globalists, banksters and corporate CEOs received virtually zilch coverage by the establishment media. \n\nAlex also looks at the Obama administration's renewed effort to target the coal industry by imposing draconian cuts in carbon emissions as part of the government's climate change agenda. \n\nOn today's broadcast, Alex talks with investigative journalist and author Jon Rappoport. Jon edits NoMoreFakeNews.com. His books include AIDS Inc.: Scandal of the Century and Oklahoma City Bombing: The Suppressed Truth.\n\n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n\n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually\n essential to seek information from a variety of sources, \n to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better \n understand the &quot;big picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon\n mainstream corporate media for news and info is a \n prescription for ignorance.
