As pets, the garter and ribbon snakes are very common in Europe, a little less-so here in America, but they are still widely kept. The only other texts I know of that deal with these snakes are either outdated or terribly off-target (i.e., they spend more time discussing broad snake-related matters and less time dealing with ribbon &amp; garter snake specifics). Dick Bartlett writes a good book on these snakes, but Philip Purser's is far superior, in my opinion. I've kept these snakes (various species) off and on through the years, and this book answers so many of the questions/issues that arose during my snake-keeping exploits. I wish it existed years ago. Definitely a soild investment for anyone interested in knowing more about these demure little serpents and their care in captivity.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3185b1d98e98dfdc673fdd39aefa25623e481cb5","amp;dn":"Quick+%26amp%3B+Easy+Garter+%26amp%3B+Ribbon+Snake+Care+-+Purser%2C+Philip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3185b1d98e98dfdc673fdd39aefa25623e481cb5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,133,177,217,142,152,223,220,103,63,221,57,174,250,37,98,62,72,28,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
