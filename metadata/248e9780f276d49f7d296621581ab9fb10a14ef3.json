Upon their formation at art college, Medicine Head became a staple of the local club circuit, eventually recording a demo which found its way to influential BBC radio personality John Peel, who began championing the track &quot;His Guiding Hand.&quot; Other DJs soon followed suit, and quickly the duo was on the brink of stardom.\nWith Peel's continued assistance, Medicine Head entered the studio to begin recording their 1970 debut LP New Bottles Old Medicine. Their focus shifted from basic blues to a more intricate sound for 1971's Heavy on the Drum, produced by former Yardbird Keith Relf; after scoring a surprise hit with the single &quot;(And the) Pictures in the Sky,&quot; Hope-Evans left the group, and was replaced by Relf and drummer John Davies for 1972's The Dark Side of the Moon. Hope-Evans rejoined prior to 1973's One and One Is One, which launched the title track to the Top Three of the U.K. singles chart.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:248e9780f276d49f7d296621581ab9fb10a14ef3","amp;dn":"Medicine+Head+-+Dark+Side+Of+The+Moon+%281972%29+%5BAPE%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"248e9780f276d49f7d296621581ab9fb10a14ef3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,142,151,128,242,118,212,159,125,41,102,33,88,26,185,251,16,161,78,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
