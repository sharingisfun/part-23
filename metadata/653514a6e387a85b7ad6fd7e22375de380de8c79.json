The Hackett release is the more generally accepted, modern translation so if you were to read only one, I would suggest the Hackett version. The Hackett version also does a better job to provide some context and background information of the discussions as well as great introductory material for an ideal perspective going in.\n\nPlato's writing style left a significant amount room for interpretation partially due to his artistic expression and his ever evolving philosophy that left many inconsistencies between his books which is why I have included the Jowlett translation so you can decide for yourself what he intended. \n\n\n\n\nPlease seed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:653514a6e387a85b7ad6fd7e22375de380de8c79","amp;dn":"Plato+-+Complete+Works.epub+%5Bnuneral%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"653514a6e387a85b7ad6fd7e22375de380de8c79","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,53,20,166,227,135,168,91,122,214,253,126,34,55,93,227,128,222,140,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
