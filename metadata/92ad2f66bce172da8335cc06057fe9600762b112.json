Opening with the straightforward--for the Femmes, anyway--Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nDonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Start Me on the Liquor,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ another Gordon Gano tale of decaying humans set to a jaunty\nbeat, and a title track vaguely reminiscent of Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½The Monster Mash,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the album settles down.The sinister\nacoustic guitar base of Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Breaking UpÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ gives way to a weird, haunted-house organ mid-section.\nÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½4 SeasonsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ offers a nod to the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s propulsive, jangling past, complete with GanoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s particularly\nstrange vocal infl ections. Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½MachineÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ features a theremin in a one-joke song about taking over the\nworld. Fortunately, it is a good joke. Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½AgamemnonÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ recalls some of the more out-there moments of the\nThey Might Be Giants catalogue, and Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½I Saw You in the CrowdÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ employs a Beatles-esque riff before\naccelerating into a scale-climbing middle section. The album ends on the more bleakly toned Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Jesus of\nRio,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ an odd combination of GanoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s personal failures, religious sentiments, and political statements.\n\n\nTracklist:\n1.
