If you think that female vocals have no place in any Floyd song, then you only have to think back to 'The Great Gig In the Sky' The artists here are pretty obscure, but excellent. \n\nThe recording/production is also very good with this album managing to sound killer on some very expensive audio systems I have played it through. \n\nThe renditions here are good enough to stand on their own, especially the version of Wish You Were Here","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc657315e53c712b0b2247b26e0f24f1435d64ba","amp;dn":"Female+vocal+Pink+Floyd+covers+FLAC+EAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc657315e53c712b0b2247b26e0f24f1435d64ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,101,115,21,229,60,113,43,11,34,71,178,110,15,36,241,67,93,100,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
