She starts at the very beginning, while awaiting her diagnosis. The story follows the cancer trail all the way through surgery, chemo, support groups, wigs, the distraction of cartooning, moving house while completely nauseated and the horror of a second diagnosis. In contrast to the heavy subject matter, Engelberg's artwork is naÃƒÂ¯ve to the extreme, though it has some charm. The true strength of the book is its fusion of the deadly serious with the absurd, in the finest tradition of black humor. Engelberg's narrative is riveting. She traces the trajectory of both her diagnosis and her growing obsession with the crossword puzzle in the newspaper's TV guide - &quot;must...avoid...inner...thought... processes,&quot; she announces. The reader discovers the author's difficulties in appreciating life's special moments, and witnesses the many compliments she receives on her post-chemo wig. We follow the way the medical profession communicates, the things people say when they don't know what to say and the utter incomprehensibility of not knowing if you're documenting your own slow death. It's extremely honest and extraordinarily powerful.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c18a4108d697d311325c952d5d88d8a74a52882","amp;dn":"Cancer+Made+Me+a+Shallower+Person","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c18a4108d697d311325c952d5d88d8a74a52882","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,24,164,16,141,105,125,49,19,37,201,82,213,216,141,138,116,165,40,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
