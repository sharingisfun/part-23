Apparently the tabloids printed a story about Elvis being a heroin addict , and Elvis took offense to the story in a BIG way. Usually a closing engagement show is a special thing , with a lot of celebrities in the crowd , a longer setlist, Elvis in a great mood, etc. Certainly there are some interesting song choices here, but the most interesting moments occur on disc 2 with the infamous &quot;Drug Monologue&quot;. \n \nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f429b975407c0433a5bf18ea6e4025e5202caeed","amp;dn":"Elvis+Presley+-+Desert+storm+-2cd-+%281997%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f429b975407c0433a5bf18ea6e4025e5202caeed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,41,185,117,64,124,4,51,165,191,24,234,110,64,37,229,32,44,174,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
