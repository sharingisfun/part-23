I. B. Beveridge\nPublisher: Norton &amp; Co.\nFormat: PDF\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\nFIRST PUBLISHED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, I95O\nREVISED EDITION, 1957\nLibrary of Congress Catalog Card No. 57-14582\nPRINTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\n\nIn The Art of Scientific Investigation, originally published in 1950, W.I.B. Beveridge explores the development of the intuitive side in scientists. The author's object is to show how the minds of humans can best be harnessed to the processes of scientific discovery. This book therefore centers on the &quot;human factor&quot;; the individual scientist. \n\nThe book reveals the basic principles and mental techniques that are common to most types of investigation. Professor Beveridge discusses great discoveries and quotes the experiences of numerous scientists. &quot;The virtue of Mr. Beveridge's book is that it is not dogmatic. A free and universal mind looks at scientific investigation as a creative art. . . .&quot; \n\nThe New York Times","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aee53b50815da70407659a2492375433afb8793c","amp;dn":"The+Art+of+Scientific+Investigation+by+W.+I.+B.+Beveridge+%5BNorto","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aee53b50815da70407659a2492375433afb8793c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,229,59,80,129,93,167,4,7,101,154,36,146,55,84,51,175,184,121,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
