And their brother's wife, Yvonne, who cooks like a dream. Not surprisingly, there's the matriarch, Esther Rose, also an artist and great cook. The Daily Feast is the collection of irresistibly tasty recipes which have won their way onto the Graber families' tables. These are the recipes they prepare for their guests. These are the dishes they make when the whole extended family gets together. For years, the Graber family cooks have passed their favorite recipes back and forth among themselves as they've scattered around the world, always learning to make and love the local dishes wherever they've lived. But always at the center of the growing collection were their own versions of beloved American dishes. In The Daily Feast, each of the 7 Graber cooks presents 3 complete menus Ã¢â‚¬â€ one for a soup meal, the second for a family week-night supper, and the third for a more elaborate guest dinner. In addition, the Grabers offer menus and recipes for their favorite special-occasion meals. Esther Rose presides over this treasury of both comforting and adventuresome recipes as effortlessly as she does her own table. Full-color photography of the finished dishes underlines the family's daily practice of beauty and good taste around the table!\n\nAbout the Author\nEsther Rose Graber, a watercolorist and book illustrator, is the matriarch of the Graber clan.
