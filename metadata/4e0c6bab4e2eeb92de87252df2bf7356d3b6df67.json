Forman, in fact, is the real center of the session, driving the sextet both rhythmically and through his interesting melodic ideas.\n\nFirst released in the U.S. in 1990, this finds the veteran tenor playing contemporary jazz, doing a good job of fitting into five Loeb and two Forman originals plus &quot;Body and Soul.&quot; \n\nNot essential music but a fine example of Getz's flexibility and creative instincts.\n\n\nSTAN GETZ\n\nBilly Highstreet Samba     1981\n\n\n- CD\n- 320Kps\n\n\nTracklist:\n1.
