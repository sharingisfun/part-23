Ya Tayr and Alamouni are both shot while Fairuz walks down the hills and valleys of the small towns exposing beautiful landscape which is nice to see and kind of authenticate the setting of the film.\n\nMiscellaneous information:\n1. Both Assy and Mansour play roles in this film. Assy has a more predominant character. He plays Abou Ahmed, the freedom fighter. Mansour role however is very small. I didn&amp;#039;t even get his name in the movie.\n2. Click here for information on the soundtrack of the film.\n\n1967 / Lebanon\nColor / Approx. Time 115 minutes\n\n\nCredits:\nFairuz ...
