The main benefit of the book is that it discusses some of the most important topics related to the heat and mass transfer in solids and particulate materials. It includes a set of new developments in the field of basic and applied research work on the physical and chemical aspects of heat and mass transfer phenomena, drying and wetting processes, namely, innovations and trends in drying science and technology, drying mechanism and theory, equipment, advanced modelling, complex simulation and experimentation. At the same time, these topics will be going to the encounter of a variety of scientific and engineering disciplines. The book is divided in several chapters that intend to be a resume of the current state of knowledge for benefit of professional colleagues","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc2dfc6693a9bc12b70e96869dda38aff0bb2c41","amp;dn":"Transport+Phenomena+and+Drying+of+Solids+and+Particulate+Materia","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc2dfc6693a9bc12b70e96869dda38aff0bb2c41","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,45,252,102,147,169,188,18,183,14,150,134,157,218,56,175,240,187,44,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
