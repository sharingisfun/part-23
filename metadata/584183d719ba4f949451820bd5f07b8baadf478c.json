Now carefully revised and broken down into four volumes to accommodate new developments, the second edition retains the original's wealth of wit and wisdom. The authors' insightful strategies, blended with their witty and irreverent style, make reading a profitable pleasure.\n\nIn Volume 3, the authors examine Games played in Clubs, giving case studies for coing and paper-and-pencil games, such as Dots-and-Boxes and Nimstring.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:584183d719ba4f949451820bd5f07b8baadf478c","amp;dn":"Winning+Ways+for+Your+Mathematicaays%2C+Second+Edition%2C+Vol.+3+%287S","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"584183d719ba4f949451820bd5f07b8baadf478c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,65,131,215,25,186,79,148,148,81,130,11,213,240,123,139,170,223,71,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
