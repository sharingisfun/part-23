With full-featured and well documented libraries all the way up the stack, Python makes network programming the enjoyable experience it should be.\n\nStarting with a walkthrough of today's major networking protocols, with this book you'll learn how to employ Python for network programming, how to request and retrieve web resources, and how to extract data in major formats over the Web. You'll utilize Python for e-mailing using different protocols and you'll interact with remote systems and IP and DNS networking.\n\nAs the book progresses, socket programming will be covered, followed by how to design servers and the pros and cons of multithreaded and event-driven architectures. You'll develop practical client-side applications, including web API clients, e-mail clients, SSH, and FTP. These applications will also be implemented through existing web application frameworks","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:acb6157d27961f65598fec077c2459fdbecb430c","amp;dn":"Learning+Python+Network+Programming+-+Dr.+M.O.+Faruque+Sarker","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"acb6157d27961f65598fec077c2459fdbecb430c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,182,21,125,39,150,31,101,89,143,236,7,124,36,89,253,190,203,67,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
