Willem Dafoe plays Eric Masters, an ultra-smooth counterfeiter who has managed to sidestep the police for years. He is so up-front about his dealings, in fact, that when some undercover agents try to make a deal with him at his health club, Eric tells them, &quot;I've been coming to this gym three times a week for five years. I'm an easy guy to find. People know they can trust me.&quot; But when young and eager Secret Service agent Richard Chance (William L. Petersen) finds out that his partner has been cold-bloodedly murdered by Eric, he trains his relentlessness upon capturing Eric -- whether it means robbery, murder, or exploiting his friends and associates. As Chance erases the dividing line between good and evil, he drags his new partner John Vukovich (John Pankow) and Ruth Lanier (Darlanne Fluegel), an ex-con, down into the maelstrom with him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTARS.........: William Petersen, Willem Dafoe, John Pankow\r\nDIRECTOR......: William Friedkin\r\nWRITERS.......: William Friedkin, Gerald Petievich\r\nGENRE.........: Action | Crime | Drama\r\nRATING........: 7.2/10  20,033 votes\r\nIMDB link.....: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090180\r\nRUNTIME.......: 1h 55mn\r\nSIZE..........: 4.74GB\r\nVIDEO CODEC...: x264 (  )\r\nRESOLUTION....: 1920x1040p\r\nBITRATE.......: 5000 Kbps (3-pass)\r\nFRAMERATE.....: 23.976 fps\r\nAUDIO1........: English DTS 5.1 768kbps\r\nAUDIO2........: Commentary with William Friedkin\r\nSOURCE........: To Live and Die in L.A.
