Traditional vocal pieces of Bulgaria have been re-arranged and professionally conducted by Bulgaria's finest conductors and turned into an unforgettable, haunting experience. Even if you are not much in to A Capella or Folklore, you should definitely give them a try as their sound is most unique.\n\nThis is the second volume, recorded in 1988. I also uploaded the first volume, so be sure to check out my torrent list.\n\n  \nCheck out my other torrents for folk, avant-garde, jazz and experimental music, all ripped in FLAC.\n\nUnfortunately, my bandwidth is somewhat limited, but I will continue to seed for a very long time, so just be patient ;-)\n\n====\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a392e35f7c921bfce4b5cb374d114965c187f099","amp;dn":"Le+Myst%C3%83%C2%A8re+des+voix+Bulgares+-+Volume+II+%281988%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a392e35f7c921bfce4b5cb374d114965c187f099","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,146,227,95,124,146,27,252,228,181,203,55,77,17,73,101,193,135,240,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
