A master at deciphering complex chord changes, Hawkins found the blues to be overly simple but around 1957 (after 35 years of major league activity) he began to explore the blues more seriously, at least on an occasional basis. This CD has nine performances from as many sessions. The music is consistently excellent (particularly &quot;Juicy Fruit,&quot; the lengthy &quot;Blues For Tomorrow&quot; which also features John Coltrane, &quot;Stealin' The Bean&quot; with trumpeter Charlie Shavers and a pair of collaborations with fellow tenor Eddie &quot;Lockjaw&quot; Davis), but it is recommended that listeners (beginners and experts alike) instead acquire the complete sessions, since the blues were only a small aspect of the Coleman Hawkins story.(AllMusic)\n\nTrack list:\n01 - Juicy Fruit\n02 - Blues For Tomorrow\n03 - Blues Wail\n04 - Soul Blues\n05 - Skronk\n06 - Stealin' The Bean\n07 - Foot Pattin'\n08 - Blues For Ron\n09 - Pedalin'\n\nEnjoy and share!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec01ee0476a047cf8a4d3c5842f34da99decaf33","amp;dn":"Coleman+Hawkins+-+1996+-+Blues+Wail+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec01ee0476a047cf8a4d3c5842f34da99decaf33","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,1,238,4,118,160,71,207,138,77,60,88,66,243,77,169,157,236,175,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
