In 'The Whispering Gallery,' the TARDIS lands in a maze-like gallery filled with thousands of talking pictures, and the Doctor and Martha discover they've come across a planet where showing emotion has been outlawed. The inhabitants have good reason for their supression, but it wouldn't be like the Doctor to leave them in fear of truly living.\n\nDoctor Who: Autopia (June 2009)\nAn All-American creative team tackles the celebrated Doctor in this special standalone tale.

But things aren't quite what they seem...\n\nDoctor Who: Room With A Deja View (July 2009)\nThe Doctor, traveling alone, lands at the scene of a murder on a space station in the middle of deep space.

Writer Rich Johnston (Whatmensch) and artist Eric J (Rex Mundi) bring you this mind-twisting tale.\n\nDoctor Who: Cold-Blooded War (August 2009)\nIn this standalone tale, the Doctor and Donna attempt to broker a peace plan between two very hierarchical and pompous alien races, the Draconians and Ice Warriors.
