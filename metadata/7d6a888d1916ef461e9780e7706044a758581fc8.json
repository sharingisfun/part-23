I worked hard to illustrate the ties between the music industry, the New Age movement, and the ecumenical body that has a one world religion in mind. Many will claim they are Christians, but few truly even know what that ensues. MMC:Redux is a documentary where I tired to use the artist own words to get the message across (as did Vol. 1) that their messages are all fundamentally the same. There is a true God, and the so called artists of the world either misses Him all together, worships their self (essentially Satanism), or they worship any god that is convenient and they deny the true living God of the Bible. The musicians discussed in this film are Beck, Radiohead, Deftones, Tool, Lady Gaga, Britney Spears, David Bowie, Gus Gus, Gary Numan, Korn, Brian Welch, Daft Punk, George Michael, Phish, TV On the Radio, Marilyn Manson, Adam Freeland, Aphex Twin, The Beatles, Goldfrapp, Tupac, Jay-z, Dr.Dre, Rick Ross, Michael Jackson, Ministry, Ozzy Osbourne, Katy Perry, Alec Empire, Kanye West, and others. Also, I discuss the Qlimax Music Festival. Oprah, Binny Hinn, Paul Couch, Joyce Meyers, Kenneth Copeland, and other FALSE prophets make special guest appearances. They show that, just like many musicians, they too feel they are ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œgodsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ or ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œlittle gods.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ \n\nIsaiah 45:5-6\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ5I am the LORD, and there is none else, there is no God beside me: I girded thee, though thou hast not known me: 6That they may know from the rising of the sun, and from the west, that there is none beside me. I am the LORD, and there is none else.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\n\nTopics discussed are:\n\n* Hand signs in the sense of what they are supposed to represent both worldly and spiritually. \n(Remember the goals of the elite or brainwashers are to dumb you down, desensitize and despiritualized you to the point you will accept the antichrist as god. So when these symbols and hand gestures are continuously pressed in your face you will see them as just thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦a hand gesture and nothing more. And why not? EveryoneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s doing it!)\n\n* Religions promoted in music and the faith that is continually denied.\n\n* Visualization techniques\n\n* Repetitive themes\n(NWO, aliens, Arian race, world peace, evolution, denial of Jesus Christ, etc.)\n\n* Symbology\n(Pyramids, swastika, all seeing eye, owl, white horse, etc.)\n\n* Ties between the now widely promoted ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œOne World ReligionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½.\n(New Age Movement, Coexist, Catholicism, liberalism, Buddhism, Hinduism, etc.)\n\n* Infiltration by the New Age Movement into the true church of Christ.\n\nPaul declares in 2 Thessalonians 2:\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ3Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition;ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nMatthew tells us in chapter 7 and verses:\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ15Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.16Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?17Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit. 18A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.19Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.20Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.&quot;\n\n\nPlease spread this around, and if you like this download my other films 100% free via torrent programs anywhere you can find torrents.
