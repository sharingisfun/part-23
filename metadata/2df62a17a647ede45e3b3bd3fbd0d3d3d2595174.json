There's been a baby boom in Dublin Zoo and over the course of series you'll be introduced to new born baby gorillas, hippos, red pandas, mangabey monkeys and many others. You'll also meet a whole host of new animals, from tiny marmosets to tarantulas and gila monsters, and catch up with some of your old favourites, including Dublin Zoo's troop of gorillas who are getting ready to set foot in their new rainforest habitat for the very first time.\n\n\n\n\n\n8)  Part 8 \nThis week in the Reptile House Garth introduces the gila monsters. It's the start of the breeding season and at this time of year these highly venomous lizards can get a little boisterous with each other. Garth tends to their wounds and introduces us to these fascinating creatures. Susan is delighted to discover that Angelina the red panda has successfully given birth to two adorable cubs and is warming quickly to her new role as protective mother to the two furry infants. There's a lot of activity happening on the macaque island, and it's now home to a number of playful young monkeys. To keep an eye on their health and well-being, it's important that Dublin Zoo perform some simple health checks, but first keepers Ciaran and Yvonne are going to round them all up. Honey, a rare Indian black buck antelope, is pregnant. Zookeeper Alice is watching her progress very carefully and, if all goes well, Dublin Zoo is hoping the new arrival will share the Kaziranga Forest Trail at Dublin Zoo with the herd of elephants that live there, just as they share a habitat in the wild.\n\n9)  Part 9 \nThe tiny pygmy marmoset baby has been doing well under Susan's watchful eye, but it's still at a delicate stage in its development and requires round the clock care. We join Susan in her home as she gives the little primate a night feed. Kasi the white-crowned mangabey has been growing bigger and stronger by the day and has even made some new friends amongst her troop. With things going so well, Helen feels the little monkey is almost ready for her full reintroduction. Brendan the zookeeper takes his love of gorillas to the road and goes in search of gorillas in the rainforests of Africa. He keeps a video diary from the heart of a Ugandan forest where he is preparing for the most thrilling encounter of his life, meeting gorillas in the wild... Eddie and his team have their hands full on Family Farm when Dublin Zoo's Tamworth pig gives birth to a litter of 9 piglets. There's good news on the African Plains too as Helen and John are delighted to discover a litter of Red River Hogs have been born overnight.\n\n10)  Part 10 \nZookeeper Brendan fulfils a lifelong ambition when he encounters a band of Mountain Gorillas on his journey into the heart of Bwindi Impenetrable National Park in Uganda. After months of hand rearing Helen and the other keepers has become very close to Kasi the baby mangabey and she has gone from strength to strength under their care. Finally, the big day has arrived and it's time for the mangabey and her keepers to part ways. We join the little monkey as she prepares to be rejoining the rest of her troop on Mangabey Island for the first time. There's great excitement in the West section where Ciaran and Gerry are keeping a close eye on Dublin Zoo's snow leopard pair. Mating season has just begun for these beautiful but critically endangered cats, and it's so far so good as they seem to be showing a lot of interest in each other. Red panda babies grow up fast as their keeper Susan knows only too well. The two youngsters are already proving quite the handful and are becoming more curious and playful by the day. Susan visits them in their habitat to give them a check-up and see how they are getting on.\n\n11)  Christmas Special \nIncluded is this hour long Christmas Special, featuring all your favourite animals and keepers coping with a snow bound zoo over the Christmas holidays.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img33.imageshack.us/img33/1492/n4fh.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img33.imageshack.us/img33/1492/n4fh.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img96.imageshack.us/img96/2633/4p8e.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img96.imageshack.us/img96/2633/4p8e.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img534.imageshack.us/img534/6606/msr5.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img534.imageshack.us/img534/6606/msr5.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img850.imageshack.us/img850/2327/xw05.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img850.imageshack.us/img850/2327/xw05.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img197.imageshack.us/img197/5338/ymul.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img197.imageshack.us/img197/5338/ymul.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img7.imageshack.us/img7/9906/nlll.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img7.imageshack.us/img7/9906/nlll.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img5.imageshack.us/img5/9382/kvpm.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img5.imageshack.us/img5/9382/kvpm.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img10.imageshack.us/img10/4950/xzs1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img10.imageshack.us/img10/4950/xzs1.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img818.imageshack.us/img818/5475/87lu.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img818.imageshack.us/img818/5475/87lu.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video: Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;2a62434d426a661e041a&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n * Video: Bitrate: 1398 Kbps\n * Video: Aspect Ratio: 1.778 (16:9)\n * Video: Resolution: 832x468\n * Audio: Codec: AAC LC\n * Audio: Bitrate: 128 Kbps VBR 48KHz\n * Audio: Channels: stereo (2/0)\n * Audio: English\n * Run-Time: 25mins\n * Framerate: 29fps\n * Number of Parts: 11\n * Part Size: average 239 MB\n * Container: Mp4\n * Source: DVD\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.thezoo.ie/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.thezoo.ie/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2df62a17a647ede45e3b3bd3fbd0d3d3d2595174","amp;dn":"RTE+The+Zoo+Series+3+Dublin+Zoo+08of11+DVDRip+x264+AAC+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2df62a17a647ede45e3b3bd3fbd0d3d3d2595174","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,246,42,23,166,71,237,228,94,59,59,211,251,208,211,211,210,89,81,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
