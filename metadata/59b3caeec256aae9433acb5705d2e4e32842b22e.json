Nameless Path (Bonus Track) 4:40\n\n\nThe highly anticipated album was recorded\nat Rockfield Studios in Monmouth, (a town in Southeast Wales), and\nproduced by Communion's Ian Grimble.\n\nIf this new album is anything like Marcus's recent debut EP release of\n&quot;Tumble Down,&quot; which featured 4 songs including Shadows of the City,\nTumble Down, Demons and You Send Me, then I, along with fans, are in\nfor a real treat. His music is different. It's a mix of old world and\nnew world with harmonies and sounds that are oftentimes grisly and\nwarbly with scatting and otherworldly tones , but always jazzy and\nsoulful. Reminiscent of Tom Waits, Van Morrison, and other independent\n&quot;carve your own niche&quot; artists.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:59b3caeec256aae9433acb5705d2e4e32842b22e","amp;dn":"Marcus+Foster+Nameless+Path","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"59b3caeec256aae9433acb5705d2e4e32842b22e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,179,202,238,194,86,170,233,67,58,203,87,5,210,228,227,40,66,178,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
