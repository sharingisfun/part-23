It will certainly have a high ranking in my personal top five of this year, as this is undoubtedly one of the best releases I have come across to till date. Daso&amp;#039;s first release Daybreak had me going through both 2005 and 2006, and I already know Meine Idee is about to do the same for years to come. If neo-trance is a religion, Daso&amp;#039;s the prophet, freshing up the electronic music industry with high-profile, innovative and dreamy sounds. &quot;\n\n- 365 International Music Magazine\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.discogs.com/release/1094621&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.discogs.com/release/1094621&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nLabel:\tSpectral Sound\nCatalog#:\tSPC-47\nFormat:\tVinyl, 12&quot;, EP\nCountry:\tUS\nReleased:\t31 Oct 2007\nGenre:\tElectronic\nStyle:\tMinimal, Tech House\n\n\nTracklisting:\n\n\n01 - Daso - Meine [7:55]\n02 - Daso - Idee [7:06]\n03 - Daso - Deine Schuhe [6:07]\n\n\n48.3MB\n\n320KBps Digial Release.\n\n\n\nI love everything Daso produces, and have been spending much time with this EP since it&amp;#039;s release.\n\nIt should be noted that the first track contained here can be categorised in many ways, including Techno Pop.  Daso is indeed a very diversely skilled and creative   producer and has always brought innovation to existing styles in the field.\n\n\nIf you haven&amp;#039;t done so already, be sure to check out my previous post of his amazing &quot;Absinthe EP&quot; on the schedule.\n\n\nYou can find out more about the well respected and innovative Daso, here:\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.myspace.com/dasofranke&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.myspace.com/dasofranke&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nEnjoy and please seed.\n\n\nthemagicke\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/themagicke&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/themagicke&lt;/a&gt;\n                                     &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.darksiderg.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.darksiderg.com/&lt;/a&gt;\t\n\n\n\n\n&quot; The latest addition to the Spectral Family is Cologne-based Daso Franke, otherwise known simply as Daso. Having released his first record only two years ago, Daso has quickly garnered international attention through releases on Traum&amp;#039;s house-oriented sublabel My Best Friend (MBF), Session Deluxe, Connaisseur and Flash Recordings. His inaugural 12&quot; for Spectral Sound, &quot;Meine Idee EP,&quot; showcases his broad range of talents and combines them into one sensational EP.\n\nThe title track, &quot;Meine,&quot; is a brilliant new take on the international techno form, maintaining a streamlined sportscar-like fluidity across its eight minutes.  The B-side offers two unique tracks, starting off with the electro-inspired &quot;Idee&quot; and its bubbling melodics.  &quot;Deine Schuhe&quot; translates into &quot;Your Shoes,&quot; perhaps a nod to the dancefloor or a bizarre childhood memory with its snappy hi-hats and mesmerizing compositional vortex.\n\nDaso truly comes into his own on his first Spectral record, expanding upon his marvelous reputation already earned in the house and techno scenes. Blending various elements throughout the EP creates a sound uniquely his own that dancefloors will no doubt covet. &quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:01563740cec5a26d80dcbf822c475d4a9a72a131","amp;dn":"Daso+-+Meine+Idee+EP+2007+%5BSPC047%5D+%5BTech+House+%2F+Minimal+Techno%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"01563740cec5a26d80dcbf822c475d4a9a72a131","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,86,55,64,206,197,162,109,128,220,191,130,44,71,93,74,154,114,161,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
