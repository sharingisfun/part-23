As it stands the Sony Bluray is currently the best transfer of this film available but unfortunately it is also censored. Previously, the only way to see this film uncut in HD was either to submit to watching the horrible MGM Bluray or the better HDTV capture.\n\nThe majority of this encode utilises the Sony Bluray as the main source with the uncut sequences from the HDTV capture being spliced in where necessary. Both these sources appear to be from a similar master of the film, although the Bluray's colour grading is slightly different. I've added grain to the sequences sourced from the HDTV capture to achieve visual parity due to its lower bitrate and, thus, worse grain retention.\n\nThe DTS track was taken from the MGM bluray and I have also added in the commentary track from the Criterion DVD. The theatrical commentary is available as a separate file. Chapter names were taken from the Criterion release, for completionists sake, which then had to be synced by hand.\n\nEnjoy and seed.\n\n-MaRWooD","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab83eeca0a931d3ba2a2ef4d9bb9a949a936f4ab","amp;dn":"RoboCop+1987+Uncut+Hybrid+720p+Bluray+DTS+x264+MaRWooD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab83eeca0a931d3ba2a2ef4d9bb9a949a936f4ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,131,238,202,10,147,29,59,162,162,239,77,155,185,169,73,169,54,244,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
