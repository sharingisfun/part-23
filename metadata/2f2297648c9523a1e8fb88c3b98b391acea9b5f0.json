Some are roughs, some are finished pencils.  We wanted to include both to show the evollution from an idea to its eventual completion.  My roughs are always just THAT, roughs.  Often I just try to capture the energy I want the piece to have, and then make my alterations, refinements, and adjustments when the ACTUAL rendering takes place.  The cover for this sketchbook was an exclusive and original piece created expressly for the fan club by myself, and the amazing combined talents of Jason Gorder and Jimmy Yu.  We hope you like it!\n\nThanks goes to Talon for this release.\n\nDon't know how to view this comic book?
