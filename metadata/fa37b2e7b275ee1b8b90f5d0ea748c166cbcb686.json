Severland, the latest from San Francisco s Blame Sally, should bring this female foursome universal acclaim. Individually, Renee Harcourt, Monica Pasqual, Jeri Jones and Pam Delgado have long displayed stirring singer-songwriter gifts. Together they re a powerhouse unit, presenting outstanding lead vocals and harmonies. Severland carves out a strong identity on the indie-pop edges of Americana. Among the highlights (though there s not a weak track among the dozen here) are the riveting title tune, the piano-driven Fillmore Street, the haunting Devil to Pay and the country-rocker Trouble. By, Paul Freeman --Palo Alto Daily News\n\nSeverland is the quartet's strongest and most cohesive album...To put it in Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young terms, Severland is their Deja Vu. That's actually not a bad starting point musically, either: acoustic guitars, piano, and creamy close harmonies predominate, with occasional hints of banjo and lap steel","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa37b2e7b275ee1b8b90f5d0ea748c166cbcb686","amp;dn":"Blame+Sally+-+Severland+%5B2007%5D%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa37b2e7b275ee1b8b90f5d0ea748c166cbcb686","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,55,178,231,178,117,238,27,139,144,245,208,234,116,140,22,108,188,182,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
