This is the story of how TR took on Manhattan vice . . . and vice won.\n\nIn the 1890s, New York City was AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s financial, manufacturing, and entertainment capital, and also its preferred destination for sin, teeming with forty thousand prostitutes, glittery casinos, and all-night dives. Police capÃ‚Â­tains took hefty bribes to see nothing while reformers writhed in frustration.\n\nIn Island of Vice, Richard Zacks paints a vivid portrait of the lewd underbelly of 1890s New York, and of Theodore Roosevelt, the puritanical, cocksure police commissioner resolved to clean it up. Writing with great wit and zest, Zacks explores how young Roosevelt goes head to head with Tammany Hall, takes midnight rambles with muckraker Jacob Riis, and tries to convince two million New Yorkers to enjoy wholesome family fun. When RooseveltÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s crackdown succeeds too well, even his supporters turn on him, and TR discovers that New York loves its sin more than its salvation.\n\nWith cameos by Stephen Crane, Mark Twain, and a horde of very angry cops, Island of Vice is an unforgettable snapÃ‚Â­shot of turn-of-the-century New York in all its seedy glory and a brilliant miniature of one of AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most colorful presidents.\n\nAuthor\n\nRICHARD ZACKS is the author of several nonfiction books, including The Pirate Hunter, An Underground Education, and History Laid Bare. His writing has appeared in the New York Times, Atlantic Monthly, Time, HarperÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s and Sports Illustrated, among many other publications. He writes in an office in New York City overlooking Union Square.\n\nUnabridged, 96kbps, read by Joe Ochman","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ebce39e18ec7ad8635c21fa55542036aede6966","amp;dn":"Richard+Zachs+-+Island+of+Vice+%5B96%5D+Unabridged","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ebce39e18ec7ad8635c21fa55542036aede6966","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,188,227,158,24,236,122,216,99,92,33,250,85,84,32,54,174,222,105,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
