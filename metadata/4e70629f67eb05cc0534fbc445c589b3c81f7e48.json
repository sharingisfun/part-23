Bhattacharya and M. Parans Paranthaman, &quot;High Temperature Superconductors&quot;\nWiley | 2010 | ISBN: 3527408274 | 245 pages | PDF\n\nThis essential reference provides the most comprehensive presentation of the state of the art in the field of high temperature superconductors. This growing field of research and applications is currently being supported by numerous governmental and industrial initiatives in the United States, Asia and Europe to overcome grid energy distribution issues. The technology is particularly intended for densely populated areas. It is now being commercialized for power-delivery devices, such as power transmission lines and cables, motors and generators. Applications in electric utilities include current limiters, long transmission lines and energy-storage devices that will help industries avoid dips in electric power.\n\nThis book can be used as a companion teaching tool and as research and professional reference. World-renowned authors explore the topic in eight entertaining chapters:\nGeneral Theory of High-Tc Superconductors\nCharacterizing Current Conduction in Coated Conductors Using Transport and Contact-Free Magnetic Methods\nCharacterization: Raman Spectroscopy Measurements and Interpretations\nYBa2Cu3O7-x Films for Coated Conductor Applications\nThallium-Oxide Superconductors\nRecent Progress in Fabrication, Characterization and Application of Hg-Based Oxide Superconductors\nSuperconductivity in MgB2","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e70629f67eb05cc0534fbc445c589b3c81f7e48","amp;dn":"High+Temperature+Superconductors+-+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e70629f67eb05cc0534fbc445c589b3c81f7e48","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,112,98,159,103,235,5,204,5,52,251,196,69,197,137,179,200,31,126,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
