But while those classic tales focus on the invasion, RESURRECTION starts when those stories end.\n\nAfter years of conflict the aliens are gone and the planet is safeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ or is it? Who ended the war? How did they do it? Where do we go from here?\n\nWritten by Marc Guggenheim (WOLVERINE) and drawn by David Dumeer, RESURRECTION (a new ongoing series) uncovers both the secrets of humanity's survival and its impending future.\n\nThis torrent includes:\n\nResurrection 01 (2007) (Minutemen-Zone)\nResurrection 02 (2008) (Minutemen-Zone)\nResurrection 03 (2008) (Minutemen-ReZone)\nResurrection 04 (2008) (Minutemen-Zone)\nResurrection 05 (2008) (Minutemen-ReZone)\nResurrection 06 (2008) (Minutemen-ReZone)\nResurrection Annual 01 (2008) (Minutemen-ReZone)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6986db3e3971810b0fe1f9e3574831015d6cdb9","amp;dn":"Resurrection+%231-6%2BAnnual+%28Minutemen-ReZone%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6986db3e3971810b0fe1f9e3574831015d6cdb9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,152,109,179,227,151,24,16,176,254,31,158,53,116,131,16,21,214,205,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
