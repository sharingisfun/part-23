They retain their nuanced and heavily-produced sound, but with a thematic focus on more worldly subjects than previous records that takes in subtler lyrical constructs and a continuation of the band&amp;#039;s development to a more poppy sound. Mercury Rev count among their ranks legendary indie producer Dave Fridmann (on bass since their formation), who has worked with such luminaries as Low and The Flaming Lips and is on production duties here.\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ce1d4976e35f7703900802b7feb40bf2b3b7303","amp;dn":"Mercury+Rev+-+Snowflake+Midnight+%5Bmp3-vbr-2008%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ce1d4976e35f7703900802b7feb40bf2b3b7303","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,225,212,151,110,53,247,112,57,0,128,43,127,235,64,191,43,59,115,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
