You are free to access your photos in existing folders, on a network or on a memory card. If you wish, you can create AfterShot Pro catalogs, then take advantage of powerful digital asset management tools to organize your collection as it grows.\n\nRobust search tools\nFinding the right photo in a collection of hundreds or thousands is fast with the Metadata tools in AfterShot Pro. Add your own searchable keywords, ratings, tags and labels. Or search by camera-written data like date, camera type, settings, aperture and more.\n\nQuick review\nEasily compare, filter and select your best photos from any number of similar shots. \n\nAdvanced, non-destructive editing\n\nPowerful adjustments\nWhether youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re shooting in RAW or JPEG, you can alter your photos using a wide variety of adjustment tools, including Crop, Straighten, Highlight Recovery, Noise Removal, Color and more.\n\nMulti-versioning editing\nEasily make adjustments to multiple versions of your master photo for virtually unlimited ways to experiment with correction options and customizable presets, including Black &amp; White, Cross Processing and more. \n\nSelective editing\nApply adjustments exactly where you want them with unique Layers and Regions capabilities that isolate precise areas of your photo for adjustment.\n\nHeal and Clone tools\nRemove distracting elements from photos with Heal and Clone tools.
