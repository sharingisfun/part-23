Starting from an integrand which is a product of powers of polynomials, integrals are explained, in an open affine space, as a pair of twisted de Rham cohomology and its dual over the coefficients of local system. It is shown that hypergeometric integrals generally satisfy a holonomic system of linear differential equations with respect to the coefficients of polynomials and also satisfy a holonomic system of linear difference equations with respect to the exponents. These are deduced from Grothendieck-Deligne &quot;s rational de Rham cohomology on the one hand, and by multidimensional extension of Birkhoff &quot;s classical theory on analytic difference equations on the other.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb880e372f9302ff1c4089e960d08b103aadcd8c","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B2011%5D+Theory+of+Hypergeometric+Functions","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb880e372f9302ff1c4089e960d08b103aadcd8c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,136,14,55,47,147,2,255,28,64,137,233,96,208,139,16,58,173,205,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
