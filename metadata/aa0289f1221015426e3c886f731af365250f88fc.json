This is the first time these hilarious stories, starring the hapless Buddy Bradley and his cast of loser cohorts, have ever been available under one cover, and never have they been available at such a low price (it would have cost at least three times as much to read all of these classic stories in any previous editions). Bagge's riotous tales of the early 1990s subculture are more hilarious now than ever, find out why he has been praised by R. Crumb, Matt Groening, John Kricfalusi, Publishers Weekly, Entertainment Weekly and many more. Comedy genius.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nThere is also a collected color volume, Buddy Does Jersey: The Complete Buddy Bradley Stories from &quot;Hate&quot; Comics Vol. 2 (1994-'98), but I don't have that one","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa0289f1221015426e3c886f731af365250f88fc","amp;dn":"Peter+Bagge+-+The+Complete+Buddy+Bradley+Stories+from+Hate","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa0289f1221015426e3c886f731af365250f88fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,2,137,241,34,16,21,66,110,60,136,111,115,26,243,101,37,15,136,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
