But for an unfortunate few, that day-to-day existence is affectedÃ¢â‚¬â€perhaps infected is a better wordÃ¢â‚¬â€by memetic incursion: where narratives the rest of the world considers fairy tales becomes reality, often with disastrous results.\n\nA motley team struggling with their own unfolding narratives, they are tasked with identifying potential outbreaks using the Aarne-Thompson Indexing and making sure the story doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t reach Ã¢â‚¬Å“ever afterÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬Â¦because if it does, someone is usually dead, brokenÃ¢â‚¬â€or worse. When you're dealing with fairy tales in the real world, it doesn't matter if you're Cinderella, Snow White, or the Wicked Queen: no one gets a happy ending.\n\nIndexing is bestselling author Seanan McGuireÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s new urban fantasy where everything you thought you knew about fairy tales gets turned on its head. \nGenre: Fantasy\n\nNote: a new episode goes up every 2 weeks.
