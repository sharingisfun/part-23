Released in 1994 by Warner Brothers - Reprise and produced by Nile Rodgers (producer of albums by David Bowie, Madonna, et cetera,) Your Filthy Little Mouth explores relatively disparate genres of popular music, but contextualizes them via rock and blues. The album reflects Roth's growing fascinations with literature and philosophy, as well as his experiences living in New York City's Lower East Side during the early 1990s. The album's artwork, based conceptually on tattoo art and graffiti art, is executed by Roth.\n\n&quot;She's My Machine&quot; became a rock radio hit in the spring of 1994, reaching #12 on Billboard's Rock Charts. The B-Side to &quot;She's My Machine,&quot; an atmospheric blues number titled &quot;Mississippi Power,&quot; is available on the Japanese edition of Your Filthy Little Mouth.\n\nDavid Lee Roth is an American rock vocalist, songwriter, actor, author, and former radio personality. In 2007, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Roth is best known as the original (1974Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1985) and current (2006Ã¢â‚¬â€œpresent) lead singer of the Southern California-based hard rock band Van Halen. He is also known as a successful solo artist, releasing numerous RIAA-certified Gold and Platinum records. \n\nRoth was born on October 10, 1954, in Bloomington, Indiana. He is the son of ophthalmologist Nathan Roth and Sibyl Roth, and the brother of Allison and Lisa Roth. Nathan Roth was a renowned eye surgeon, who made millions via his practice and in real estate. The senior Roth was featured on the TV show Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous in 1984 on which he claims that he was Van Halen's first manager helping the group obtain gigs in the early days.\n\nAfter living in Bloomington, Indiana, and Swampscott, Massachusetts, Roth moved to Pasadena, California, while he was in his teens. Roth stated he 'bounced around' a number of schools, and saw a psychiatrist for three years, eventually attending a ranch for troubled teens, where he cared for a horse to build a sense of responsibility. He attended The Webb Schools in Claremont, California, and John Muir High School in Pasadena, then Pasadena City College (although he did not graduate) where he met the Van Halen brothers, Eddie and Alex. During this period Roth worked as a hospital orderly.\n\nAfter more than two decades apart, Roth re-joined Van Halen in 2006 for a North American tour that became the highest grossing in the band's history and one of the highest grossing of that year. In 2012, Roth and Van Halen released the critically successful comeback album, A Different Kind of Truth.\n(video does not have any logos)\n\n\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Your_Filthy_Little_Mouth&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Your_Filthy_Little_Mouth&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/nacoiaAfJ&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/nacoiaAfJ&lt;/a&gt; \n   \n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:     \n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x480 (4:3) 29.97fps 8000kbps\n   Audio: LPCM 48000Hz stereo 1536kbps [DVD LPCM, 16 bit]\n   Duration: 00:03:55\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
