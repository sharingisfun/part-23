In fact, there aren't many people who can match him on the slide guitar. Listen to &quot;Serious as a Heart Attack,&quot; and you'll hear what I mean.\n\nOther than &quot;Just Like a Woman,&quot; the songs are mostly in the traditional urban blues form, but played with a hard edge. These tracks are very close to what Johnny did on his trendsetting &quot;Progressive Blues Experiment&quot; LP back in the late '60s. It's Chicago blues spiced with a dose of rock and roll.\n\nThis CD will be appreciated by anyone who appreciates expert guitar playing. If you are a rock fan but haven't listened to much blues, I encourage you to listen to Johnny Winter to see what you've been missing.\n\n[Amazon user]\n\n\n\n1.: Introduction\n2.: Okie Dokie Stomp\n3.: Looking For Trouble\n4.: Serious As A Heart Attack\n5.: Blue Mood\n6.: Sugaree\n7.: Ain't That Just Like A Woman\n8.: Shake That Money Maker\n9.: Mad Dog\n10.: Rollin' And Tumblin' (acoustic/bonus track)\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0bc29146dbf223aa6dcab0a799f959f9e6fa1637","amp;dn":"Johnny+Winter-Live+Bootleg+Series%2C+Vol.+4%282009%29%5BEAC-FLAC%5D%5BTWR124","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0bc29146dbf223aa6dcab0a799f959f9e6fa1637","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,194,145,70,219,242,35,170,109,202,176,167,153,249,89,249,230,250,22,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
