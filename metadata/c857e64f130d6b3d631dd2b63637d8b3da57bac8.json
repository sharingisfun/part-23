A few short months later, Hetherington was killed by mortar shells while photographing the front lines of the Libyan civil war.\n\nWhich Way Is the Front Line From Here? is his family and friendsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ collective grieving Ã¢â‚¬â€œ catharsis by celebration and a deeply felt sense of admiration for the British-American war photographer who captured modern warfare with searing realism by rebuking one of journalismÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s greatest textbook tenets: Never make the story about yourself. This intimate portrait, directed by Junger, also eschews objectivity, but in favor of pathos, communicating just as pointedly as Hetherington transmitted emotion through his work.\n\nUsing shots culled from his comrades, as well as ghostly found footage, the documentary traces HetheringtonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s career photographing conflicts in West Africa and the Middle East, right up to the final moments before his death. And while there are plenty of interspersed interviews with family and colleagues from the field, much of what we see is from behind HetheringtonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s camera.\n\nAs affable a presence as Hetherington was, he was a workaholic; his work was his life, and this doc is Junger assembling the chapters of a years-in-the-making video memoir. That it comes too soon is rendered in the swelling, pained eyes of his longtime field partner, James Brabazon, whose tearful breakdown is perhaps the filmÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most devastating moment.\n \nAs it should be, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s heavy emphasis on HetheringtonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s work. But this isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t a movie about the photojournalistic process, military stratagems, or political posturing. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s about HetheringtonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s almost intimate understanding that art is felt Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and more often than not, that feeling is overwhelming pain. You see it in his photos: the desperate, lonely faces of Liberian children, the piercing and guttural pang of defeat felt by a solider who loses his brother-in-arms. Hetherington was a masterful journalist exposing the world to its obscured horror, but he was only able to capture it by becoming so close to the terror that he felt it too.\n\nThe sequences stitched together by Junger, which include segments from HetheringtonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Faulknerian and autobiographical short film Diary, indicate the skill of a fledging filmmaker on the verge on his own breakthrough. He had a tight, closed-in feel to his images and video that made it feel like you were being captured inside moments with HetheringtonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s subjects Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a weird, transfixing layering effect that came from an auteur who maybe cared a little too much.\n\n[b]Video[/b]\nFormat : MPEG-4\nID : 1\nFormat : AVC\nFormat/Info : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;044c6d636c4448302a34&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script data-cfhash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;data-cfhash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}t.parentNode.removeChild(t);}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nFormat settings, CABAC : Yes\nFormat settings, ReFrames : 3 frames\nCodec ID : avc1\nCodec ID/Info : Advanced Video Coding\nDuration : 1h 17mn\nSource duration : 1h 17mn\nBit rate : 2 194 Kbps\nWidth : 1 920 pixels\nHeight : 1 080 pixels\n\n[b]Audio[/b]\nFormat : AAC","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c857e64f130d6b3d631dd2b63637d8b3da57bac8","amp;dn":"Which+Way+Is+the+Front+Line+from+Here%3F+The+Life+and+Time+of+Tim+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c857e64f130d6b3d631dd2b63637d8b3da57bac8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,87,230,79,19,13,107,61,99,29,210,182,54,55,216,179,218,87,186,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
