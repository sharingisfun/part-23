The classical tradition of North Indian music is marked both by a strong adherence to its own origins and an openness to influences from other cultures. On the other hand, European art music of the Middle Ages, seemingly far removed and accessible only by means of written documents, has clearly recognizable roots in Eastern traditions.\r\n\r\nIn their respective musical development, Dominique Vellard and Ken Zuckerman have each been strongly influenced by a variety of experiences with Eastern music traditions. The Schola Cantorum Basiliensis, where both teach in the medieval program, became the meeting place where they were able to compare notes and develop an organic approach to experimentation.\r\n\r\nThe music on this CD was recorded as a live studio performance. For the Indian music performances, this spontaneity and improvised atmosphere is an extremely important ingredient to any rendering of the ragas and talas, but the improvised accompaniments of the monophonic songs definitely also benefitted from this unique â€œliveâ€ quality.\r\n\r\n01 Gace BrulÃ©: Biaus mâ€™est estez\r\n02 Ken Zuckerman: Improvisation on Biaus mâ€™est estez\r\n03 Gregorian chant: In omnem terram\r\n04 Traditional Indian: Raga Lankadahang Sarang\r\n05 Guillaume de Machaut: Mors sui\r\n06-07 Traditional Indian: Raga Madhu malati\r\n08 Jehannot de lâ€™Escurel: Dis tans plus\r\n09 Ken Zuckerman: Improvisation on Dis tans plus\r\n10 Anonymous: La charramanga\r\n11 Traditional Indian and Persian: Percussion soli and duet\r\n12 Traditional Indian: Raga Koushi Bhairavi","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a7a55732080e6ab992adc2606aa02df509a1fa4","amp;dn":"Indian+Ragas+and+Medieval+Song%3A+Modal+melodies+from+East+to+West","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a7a55732080e6ab992adc2606aa02df509a1fa4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,122,85,115,32,128,230,171,153,42,220,38,6,170,2,223,80,154,31,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
