Middlewest Chant showcases the duoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s original songs and II. Mountain Shout features the duoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s favorite traditional tunes. These projects blend the loving attention of revivalist fervor with the raw creativity of brand new sounds. Whether rendering a traditional tune or one of their many original compositions, the duo infuses each song with musical imagination, haunting harmonies and instrumental artistry. The two projects are separate but intertwined - companion pieces that stand alone but also complement one another. Beauchamp explains, Ã¢â‚¬Å“We love pushing the boundaries of what a traditional song can be - thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a real energy exchange between the old and the new.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ In this pair of new releases, Red Tail Ring offers listeners originality and traditionalism in every cut. He adds, Ã¢â‚¬Å“For us, the dichotomy is always there: the precision and grit of the music, the stories that speak to the core of human experience and tell our story at the same time.&quot;\n\nAll songs on Mountain Shout are traditional except for &quot;Vamp For John,&quot; and homage to John Hartford, written by Michael Beauchamp and Laurel Premo.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:101d274b8324e57dd2e89f2fd828206f3cb42093","amp;dn":"Red+Tail+Ring+-+Mountain+Shout+%5B2011%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"101d274b8324e57dd2e89f2fd828206f3cb42093","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,29,39,75,131,36,229,125,210,232,159,47,216,40,32,111,60,180,32,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
