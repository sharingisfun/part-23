The game is a real time strategy, depicting the war to unite Japan in the 17th century. Players control armies across wide open battlefields using a bird's-eye view. Special cutscenes allow players to view attacks, while zoom screens allow players to watch the engagement unfold.\n\nThis is an .iso file. Runs okay on emulator, with only one serious glitch on user interface.\n\nNTSC USA, Eng, PS2","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa91a2d7a61149eca2dc5c82ba1f90f6db5d6c4c","amp;dn":"Kessen+%5BNTSC+USA%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa91a2d7a61149eca2dc5c82ba1f90f6db5d6c4c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,145,162,215,166,17,73,236,162,220,92,130,186,31,144,246,219,93,108,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
