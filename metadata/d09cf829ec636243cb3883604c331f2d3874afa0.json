To play the grooves RG is using a keyboard layout of &quot;major chords&quot; and &quot;minor chords&quot;, each with two sequence patterns (A or B) option.\nIt is only a matter of hitting a single note in the major keyboard range or minor keyboard range and the groove plays. The sound sets are clean sampled guitars, which gives you great freedom and flexibility when using the synthesizer features and effects of RG.\n\nRG 1.5 Guitar types included are:\n- The classic Fender Stratocaster ? electric guitar (major and minor7 chords)\n- A 8th note groove type Steel String acoustic guitar (major and minor chords)\n- A 16th note groove type Steel String acoustic guitar (major and minor chords)\n- A Power Chord groove type Distorted guitar ( 5ths chords / absense of 3rd)\n- Muted Low and Muted High groove type guitar (single notes / no chords)\n\nThe synthesizer parts of RG include a classic analog modelled synthesizer filter, LFO, envelopes and modulation section. The effect section can be built up by using up to 3 effects at a time. Included are midi time-based delays, chorus and also speaker simulators, phaser, flanger and many more. Included are over 1000 presets included 850 &quot;RG&quot; grooves and 300 &quot;basic&quot; grooves.
