The first two versions of iOS 7 beta used Helvetica Neue Light, which at times was bit hard to read. The latest version changes it to Helvetica Neue Regular, which is a lot more legible. Light and Ultra Light are still visible in certain places in the UI but less frequently than before.\nOther changes include bigger status bar on the lockscreen, new animation for app downloads, dots in Calendar app to indicate events on particular days, new music player controls and much more.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b963f85d846ba54ae2daf13cc5e772306403ca1","amp;dn":"Apple+iOS+7+Beta+3+With+Activation+For+iPhone+4S+-Ak0-DLM-+%28Kurd","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b963f85d846ba54ae2daf13cc5e772306403ca1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,150,63,133,216,70,186,84,174,45,175,19,204,94,119,35,6,64,60,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
