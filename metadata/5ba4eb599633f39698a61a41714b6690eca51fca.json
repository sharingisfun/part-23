Matthew Houck's charming croon is surprisingly close to Jason Lytle's iconic whine, and he has a similar gift for words: take the line &quot;a long time is what forever is&quot; on the rambling, glimmering opener, &quot;Salt &amp; Blues,&quot; for example. Athens, GA's Houck has the restlessness of Dylan, the home-recording vibe of Miighty Flashlight, and the at times dark, at times golden Southern narratives of Will Oldham and Papa M, but his compositions -- like &quot;Where to Strip&quot; -- are stretched into a dreamy slo-fi state like Neil Halstead revisiting his old band Slowdive. Houck received heaps of praise in England for his old one-man folk outfit Fillup Shack. And though the London Evening Standard's claim that &quot;he may prove to be the most significant American in his field since Kurt Cobain,&quot; may have been a bit premature, Phosphorescent's A Hundred Times or More -- though difficult, is clearly one of the best indie folk records of 2003, from the syrupy-bittersweet, Billy Corgan-worthy bombast of &quot;Bullet&quot; to the beautifully forlorn (and Bright Eyes-esque) &quot;How Far We All Come Away.&quot;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ba4eb599633f39698a61a41714b6690eca51fca","amp;dn":"Phosphorescent+-+A+Hundred+Times+Or+More+%5B2003%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ba4eb599633f39698a61a41714b6690eca51fca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,164,235,89,150,51,243,150,152,166,26,65,113,75,102,144,236,165,31,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
