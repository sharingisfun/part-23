In order to become a real boy, Pinocchio must prove himself worthy. He sets out into the world, accompanied by his &quot;conscience,&quot; Jiminy Cricket. Pinocchio is led astray by the wicked fox J. Worthington Fowlfellow, first to &quot;a life in the theater&quot;- Stromboli's puppet show - and then to Pleasure Island, where boys behave like (and become!) jackasses. Pinocchio redeems himself by saving Geppetto from Monstro, the whale.\n\nGenre:Animation | Family | Fantasy | Musical\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac4abe90fa3c7ed46018f861f40d16c6bf8cf83c","amp;dn":"Pinocchio.1080p.AC+3%28DD%29.7.1ch.Blu-ra+y.PS3-TEAM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac4abe90fa3c7ed46018f861f40d16c6bf8cf83c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,74,190,144,250,60,126,212,96,24,248,97,244,13,22,198,191,140,248,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
