Rick takes us on a dawn-to-dusk insiderÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s tour that separates the hip from the hype, sharing some of the cityÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s quirkiest, most happening hotspots, starting with an early morning cappuccino and Enfrijoladas (creamy bean-sauced tortillas) at an organic market and cafÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© in ultra-cool Condesa, the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSoHo of Mexico City,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and shows how to replicate this soulful breakfast in his home kitchen.

Surveying the city at sunset from the rooftop bar of a hot new hotel, Rick muses on the unique combination of old and new that defines everything he loves about the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCapital of Hip.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\n* Video Codec : H.264(MPEG-4 AVC)\n* Video Bitrate : 1536kbps\n* Aspect Ratio : 1.778\n* Audio Codec : AAC\n* Audio Bitrate : 128kbps\n* Runtime : ~23 mins\n* Resoution : 848x480","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7746cdc01169f7f84e27e8d9537b4f5abc71c1d5","amp;dn":"Mexico.One.Plate.at.a.Time.With.Rick.Bayless.S04E04.The.Capital.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7746cdc01169f7f84e27e8d9537b4f5abc71c1d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,70,205,192,17,105,247,248,78,39,232,217,83,123,79,90,188,113,193,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
