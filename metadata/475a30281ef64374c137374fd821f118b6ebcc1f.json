He puts the car in his garage but when his wife sees the lights flashing, she thinks they have an intruder. In fact, its just the car acting up. In the middle of the night, his car horn honks and when his wife takes it out the next day, it stops at the exact corner where the accident occurred. When his competitor at the office, Pete Radcliff, is arrested he thinks he's home free. It's apparent however that the car is going to continue acting up until Pope makes things right.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:475a30281ef64374c137374fd821f118b6ebcc1f","amp;dn":"The+Twilight+Zone+-+You+Drive","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"475a30281ef64374c137374fd821f118b6ebcc1f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,90,48,40,30,246,67,116,193,55,55,79,216,33,241,24,182,235,204,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
