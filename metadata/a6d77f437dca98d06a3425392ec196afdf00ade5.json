The TG12345 consoles were custom-built for EMI's  studios  \n   and were never sold commercially.   \n              \n   The  plug-in  brings  the  sound of  this  rare  and  sought-after unit  to  \n   computer-based DAWs and sets a new standard in vintage hardware  modelling.  \n   It  functions as  a 2:1  compressor or  as a  limiter with  up to  20dB of  \n   limiting and accurately reproduces the behaviour of the original. It can be  \n   used  on  mono,  stereo  and multi-channel  tracks,  supporting  up  to 7.1  \n   surround operation.  \n              \n   Two plug-in modules are included, providing variations on the TG sound: the  \n   ÃƒÂ¦1969Ãƒâ€  module  is modelled  on the  original from  the EMI  console and the  \n   ÃƒÂ¦2005Ãƒâ€   module  is based  on  Chandler LimitedÃƒâ€ s  hardware  reissue of  the  \n   TG12413, the TG1.  \n              \n              \n   Key Features  \n              \n              \n   Classic and contemporary modules   \n              \n   Compressor and limiter modes from the original hardware   \n              \n   TG-style controls and gain reduction meter   \n              \n   Mono, stereo and multi-channel operation   \n              \n   Automation and control surface support  \n                                              \n\n                ____________________________________________________\n\n\nTested clean on a Windows 8 x64 virtual machine running with ESET Nod 32 5.2.9.1\nVirus database v.8361 (2013 05 22)\n\n\n                ____________________________________________________\n\n\n\nInstructions:\n\n\n\n     1.Uninstall previous versions.                              \n                                                                \n                                                                \n     2.Unrar and install.                                        \n                                                                  \n                                                                  \n     3.Enjoy!                                                    \n\n\n\nIn case the Plugins don't show up in your VSTPlugins list\n\n                Google for Microsoft's free Visual C++ Runtimes:\n\n                             vcredist 2005 sp1\n                                   \n                                    and\n                             \n                             vcredist 2008 sp1\n\n             Install these runtimes, reboot and rescan your plugs\n\n                ____________________________________________________\n\nSupport the software creators !\n\n________________\n\nPS: Help me to seed please, I have a 1 mbps bandwidth and this is the only release of Abbeyroadplugins.TG.12413.Limiter on The Pirate Bay !\nPost feedback please as i'm a new uploader ! :)\n\n________________\n\nTHANKS TO TEAM ASSiGN.\nABOD.
