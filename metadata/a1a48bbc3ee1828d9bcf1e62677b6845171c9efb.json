Three years later    |\n|  Pleather was picked up by Grass/Interscope, but it wasn&amp;#039;t until 1995      |\n|  when the band scored big with their single &quot;Possum Kingdom&quot; from their    |\n|  mainstream breakthrough Rubberneck. Frontman Todd Lewis&amp;#039; angry vocals     |\n|  were fitting for the post-grunge scene swirling into a loop during that   |\n|  time and tours with Bush, Red Hot Chili Peppers, and the Butthole         |\n|  Surfers were motivating; however, the Toadies vanished. Lewis, bassist    |\n|  Lisa Umbarger, drummer Mark Reznicek, and guitarist Darrell Herbert       |\n|  basically took a break during the latter part of the decade. Herbert      |\n|  left prior to the new millennium and was replaced by Clark Vogeler and a  |\n|  new maturation within the band took place. By 2001, the Toadies had a     |\n|  riveting and fresh new sound captured on the long-awaited sophomore       |\n|  effort, Hell Below Stars Above. Before the year&amp;#039;s end, however, the       |\n|  group had disbanded, the end officially marked by the appearance of Best  |\n|  of the Toadies: Live From Paradise in the fall of 2002.                   |\n|                                                                            |\n+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a1a48bbc3ee1828d9bcf1e62677b6845171c9efb","amp;dn":"Toadies-No_Deliverance-%28Advance%29-2008-FM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a1a48bbc3ee1828d9bcf1e62677b6845171c9efb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,164,139,188,62,225,130,141,155,207,30,98,103,123,104,69,23,28,158,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
