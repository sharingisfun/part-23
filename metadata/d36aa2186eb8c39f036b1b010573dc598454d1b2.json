I found this place because it was low rent and decided to have no tv for a few months which ended up closer to a year. Often over the years all those beautiful psalms would spring up like 'you are my refuge, my fortress, sheild etc. After coming home from work one day, I was walking around the house speaking a few psalms and feeling nothing in particular. When I casually spoke out 'You have made me glad' the presence of God filled my heart as worship began to flow out of my spirit to God. I was overwhelmed as He gave me fresh revelation that day that it doesn't matter where I am, if it's in the slums somewhere or in a plush hotel, Jesus is the one who makes me glad and all my joy is found in Him!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d36aa2186eb8c39f036b1b010573dc598454d1b2","amp;dn":"Miriam_Webster-Made_Me_Glad%282010%29-126kbps-RASUNGOD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d36aa2186eb8c39f036b1b010573dc598454d1b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,106,162,24,110,184,195,159,3,107,27,1,5,115,220,89,132,84,209,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
