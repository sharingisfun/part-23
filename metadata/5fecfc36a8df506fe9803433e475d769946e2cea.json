I record this for everyone as well as for myself to listen to later on. Later on is when I discovered the missing time with Rush. So I borrowed that 20 minutes from another torrent and spliced it into hour 2 after deleting all those commercials. That first segment is from WVNN, Huntsville, Alabama. The mp3 was enhanced a little to match the rest of it and it does sound ok. This took me a few hours to do. Hour 2 was very good and worth hearing and saving so I wanted to get it posted. The station sent out the wrong signal and I didn't realize it till too late.\n\nSo here it is fixed.
