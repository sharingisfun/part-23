The 24 brisk, crisp instrumental tracks on Flying Fingers\n    (running under one hour) were cut mostly for Columbia between 1955 and\n    1960; the 1955-1957 stuff was recorded between sides by Rose Lee Maphis,\n    and she is present there playing guitar, with Larry Collins (featured on\n    four numbers, on top of which his sister Lorrie is the subject of the\n    title of the Maphis original &quot;Lorrie Ann&quot;), Johnny Bond, and Leon Silby\n    joining the guitar accompaniment on the later sessions. In addition to\n    guitar, Maphis himself plays banjo and autoharp on various tracks. The\n    best showcase to date of Maphis' work, the music features what seem like\n    superhuman feats of dexterity, reminiscent of Jascha Heifetz's 1930s\n    recordings on the violin, only better -- every note is hit spot-on, but\n    the playing never loses its warmth or seems mechanical. Listeners may\n    swear that the masters of &quot;Flying Fingers,&quot; &quot;Fire on the Strings,&quot; and\n    &quot;Floggin' the Banjo&quot; must have been sped up, but they weren't. While they\n    may constitute highlights, they're not alone. Other high spots include\n    &quot;Katy Warren Breakdown,&quot; by session fiddle player Fiddlin' Kate Warren,\n    and the cover of &quot;Sweet Fern&quot; by A.P. Carter. There's also a lot of variety,\n    especially with the presence of the four Collins sides, which rock pretty\n    hard; &quot;Early American&quot; shows some strong blues elements.\n\n    -- Bruce Eder","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0bd8444506ad6ded41bdedd794d79b660c851f26","amp;dn":"Joe+Maphis+-+Flying+Fingers","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0bd8444506ad6ded41bdedd794d79b660c851f26","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,216,68,69,6,173,109,237,65,189,237,215,148,215,155,102,12,133,31,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
