Co-written and produced by the hit team Xenomania, the album takes its title from a line in the song &quot;Sweet About Me&quot;, which would become a worldwide hit.\n\nAmazon.co.uk review By Danny McKenna - It's hard to imagine someone even younger than 19-year-old Laura Marling making a splash on the music scene, but 16-year-old Australian singer Gabriella Cilmi is doing a pretty good job. Having smashed apart stereotypes of innocence with her killer single &quot;(ThereÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s Nothing) Sweet About Me&quot;, Cilmi (pronounced &quot;Chill Me&quot;) now offers a debut that's not only lyrically and emotionally mature, but boasts the kind of potent musical content guaranteed to propel you towards the dancefloor. Lessons To Be Learned is a diverse bag. Produced by Xenomania (Girls Aloud, Sugababes) it's seemingly influenced by everyone from Stevie Wonder and the Kings of Leon, though it'll inevitably draw the most comparisons to Amy Winehouse, thanks to Cilmi's soaring vocals, the record's modern-Motown feel and XenomaniaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s bright, punchy production. Opener &quot;Save The Lies&quot;, though, is nothing like Winehouse--a big, in-your-face disco-stomper with a massive irrefutable chorus. The record drops from there into sultry soul territory with tracks like &quot;Sanctuary&quot;, &quot;Einstein&quot;, and &quot;Safer&quot;, and more upbeat fare such as the electronic &quot;DonÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢t Wanna Go To Bed Now&quot;, rocky tracks like &quot;Messy&quot; and the bluesy &quot;Cigarettes And Lies&quot;. These stylistic diversions set Cilmi apart from the rest of the 'new soul' brigade, and help give her a voice of her own\n\t\nTrack Listings \n\n[01] Save The Lies\n[02] Sweet About Me\n[03] Sanctuary\n[04] Einstein\n[05] Got No Place To Go\n[06] Don't Want To Go To Bed Now\n[07] Messy\n[08] Awkward Game\n[09] Safer\n[10] Cigarettes And Lies\n[11] Terrifying\n[12] Sit In The Blues\n[13] Echo Beach\n\nTotal Mp3 Play Time\t&gt; 00h:43m:40s\nTotal File Size\t&gt; 115mb (Including MP3s, Art Covers &amp; File)\nTotal Bit Size\t&gt; 320kbps\nMusic File Type\t&gt; I-Tunes v.9.0.0.70 MP3 Format\nMusic Video Format\t&gt; N / A\nScanned Artwork\t&gt; Yes @ 300dpi &amp; 200dpi\nOriginal CD Rip\t&gt; Yes - only1joe\nOriginal Uploader\t&gt; Yes - only1joe \nUpload Speed\t&gt; 33-35KB/s\nMusic Genre\t&gt; Pop\nRelease Date\t&gt; 31 March 2008\nRecord Company\t&gt; Universal Island Records\nArtists WebSite\t&gt; \n\n&gt; http://www.gabriellacilmi.com\n&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriella_Cilmi\n&gt; http://www.azlyrics.com/g/gabriellacilmi.html\n\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n* * * I Will Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents * * *\n* * * This Is A Multi-Tracker Torrent Check Your Bit Torrent Client For A True Number Of Seeds * * *\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f62e75c3ca094bd306a72794138f1782699c9d21","amp;dn":"%5B2008%5D+Lessons++Learned+-+Gabriella+Cilmi+%40+FLAC+%5Bonly1joe%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f62e75c3ca094bd306a72794138f1782699c9d21","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,46,117,195,202,9,75,211,6,167,39,148,19,143,23,130,105,156,157,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
