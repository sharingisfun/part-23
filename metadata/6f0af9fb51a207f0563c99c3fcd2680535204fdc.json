To this end, Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg, an Army officer convinced he must save Germany from Hitler, is recruited to mastermind a real plan. To do so, he arranges for the internal emergency measure, Operation: Valkyrie, to be changed to enable his fellows to seize control of Berlin after the assassination of the Fuhrer. However, even as the plan is put into action, a combination of bad luck and human failings conspire on their own to create a tragedy that would prolong the greater one gripping Europe.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f0af9fb51a207f0563c99c3fcd2680535204fdc","amp;dn":"VALKYRIE+2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f0af9fb51a207f0563c99c3fcd2680535204fdc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,10,249,251,81,162,7,240,86,60,153,195,252,210,104,5,53,32,79,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
