Jean-Claude Van Damme ? Dolph Lundgren ? Well, here we have both on the 3th part of UNIVERSAL SOLDIER.\nNeed description ? Well you'll have it, but no samples. It's unuseful. You know I'm a trusted uploader, so I do not post FAKES, corupted files, bad quality etc. Only good stuff. Just download and watch. Enjoy !\n&quot;With stolen top-secret technology, terrorists have created a next-generation Universal Soldier - an elite fighter genetically altered into a programmable killing machine. With this &quot;UniSol&quot; leading the way, they seize the crippled Chernobyl nuclear reactor, threatening to unleash a lethal radioactive cloud. The only one who can stop them is Luc Deveraux (Jean-Claude Van Damme), a UniSol who's been decommissioned for years. Reactivated and retrained, Deveraux must make a full-out assault on the heavily armed fortress. But inside, he'll discover not one but two of these virtually indestructible warriors. Andrew Scott (Dolph Lundgren), Deveraux's vicious UniSol enemy from the original Universal Soldier, has been secretly reanimated and upgraded. Now, these elite fighters are locked, loaded and programmed to kill; and the fate of millions hinges on this high-action showdown&quot;\n\nGenre: Action | Drama | Sci-Fi\nIMDB rating: 8.7/10 (348 votes) http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1288403/\nDirected by: John Hyams\nStarring: Jean-Claude Van Damme, Dolph Lundgren\n\nRelease Name: Universal Soldier-Regeneration DvDSCR XviD-DELETHiS\nSize: 701MB \nVideo: XVID, 640ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€272, 987 kbps, 23 fps\nAudio: Mp3, 131 kbps\nRuntime: 97 minutes\nFilename: Universal Soldier-Regeneration DvDSCR XviD-DELETHiS.avi","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:719d3a640282d17b357f68e4bc54f7e406e8e316","amp;dn":"Universal+Soldier-Regeneration+DvDSCR+XviD-DELETHiS.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"719d3a640282d17b357f68e4bc54f7e406e8e316","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,157,58,100,2,130,209,123,53,127,104,228,188,84,247,228,6,232,227,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
