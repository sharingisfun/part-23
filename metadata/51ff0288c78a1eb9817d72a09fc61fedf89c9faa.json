He received a BA in English and American literature in 1984 and an MA and Ph.D. in psychology from Saybrook University, in San Francisco, CA twenty years later. He spent the intervening decades traveling around the world, living in unexpected places working odd jobs (e.g., gutting salmon in Alaska, teaching English to prostitutes in Bangkok and self-defense to land-reform activists in Mexico, managing commercial real-estate in New YorkÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Diamond District, helping Spanish physicians publish their research). Drawing upon his multi-cultural experience, RyanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s academic research focused on trying to distinguish the human from the cultural. His doctoral dissertation analyzes the prehistoric roots of human sexuality, and was guided by the psychologist, Stanley Krippner.\n\n-----------------\n\nThis is the Joe Rogan Experience Podcast #306 64k Time Warped version. Time warped means the audio is played 35% faster but without changing the pitch. They just talk a lot faster =)\nThe reason behind this is to save time for the JRE junkies out there, you save about 50 minutes of your life on a 3 hour podcast. Aint that just great? Since its encoded with OGG aoTuVb q0 its also smaller in filesize and good quality.\n\nSponsors: Onnit (http://www.onnit.com), Ting (http://rogan.ting.com) etc..\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:51ff0288c78a1eb9817d72a09fc61fedf89c9faa","amp;dn":"Joe+Rogan+Experience+%23306+-+Christopher+Ryan+%5B64k%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"51ff0288c78a1eb9817d72a09fc61fedf89c9faa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,255,2,136,199,138,30,185,129,125,114,160,159,198,31,237,248,156,159,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
