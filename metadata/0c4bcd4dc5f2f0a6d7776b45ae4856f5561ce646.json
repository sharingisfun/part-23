Once she was an \nart student dreaming of creativity and freedom; now, after marrying Peter at \nschool and being brought back to once quaint, now tourist-overrun \nWaytansea Island, She's been reduced to the condition of a resort-hotel \nmaid. Peter, it turns out, has been hiding rooms in houses he's remodeled and \nscrawling vile messages all over the wallsÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½an old habit of builders but \ndramatically overdone in Peter's case. Angry homeowners are suing left and \nright, and Misty's dreams of artistic greatness are in ashes. But then, as if \npossessed by the spirit of Maura Kinkaid, a fabled Waytansea artist of the \nnineteenth century, Misty begins painting again, compulsively. But can her \nnewly discovered talent be part of a larger, darker plan? Of course it can...\n\nDiary is a dark, hilarious, and poignant act of storytelling from America's \nfavorite, most inventive nihilist. It is Chuck Palahniuk's finest novel yet.\n\n----\n\nRead by Martha Plimpton\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c4bcd4dc5f2f0a6d7776b45ae4856f5561ce646","amp;dn":"Chuck+Palahniuk+-+Diary","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c4bcd4dc5f2f0a6d7776b45ae4856f5561ce646","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,75,205,77,197,242,240,166,215,119,107,69,174,72,86,245,86,28,230,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
