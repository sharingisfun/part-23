Music from the Drew Carey Show. For some listeners, 20 tracks may be overkill, but the album contains a nice balance of performances lifted from the show -- including Carey's &quot;High Hopes,&quot; Kira (&quot;Mandy&quot;) and &quot;God Bless America,&quot; plus the Winfred-Louder Staff's &quot;Working in the Coal Mine&quot; and &quot;Tomorrow,&quot; as well as the Reverend Horton Heat's &quot;Now, Right Now&quot; -- and songs that have featured heavily in the show (&quot;Five O'Clock World,&quot; &quot;Shake Your Groove Thing,&quot; &quot;Lust for Life&quot; and &quot;Cleveland Rocks,&quot; included in both the Presidents' remake and the Hunter original). In short, it's almost everything a Drew Carey fan could want (even though a version of &quot;A Taste of Honey&quot; would have been nice), and it certainly evokes the nutty charm of the show.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/cleveland-rocks-music-from-the-drew-carey-show-r348291/review&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/cleveland-rocks-music-from-the-drew-carey-show-r348291/review&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n01 - Cleveland Rocks\n02 - Moon Over Parma (Main Title)\n03 - Five O'Clock World\n04 - High Hopes (LP Version)\n05 - What Is Hip\n06 - Kira (Mandy)\n07 - The Time Warp\n08 - Shake Your Groove Thing\n09 - God Bless America\n10 - You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet\n11 - Free Ride\n12 - Rocky Mountain Way (LP Version)\n13 - Working In The Coal Mine\n14 - Working In The Coal Mine (LP Version)\n15 - A Taste Of Honey (LP Version)\n16 - Now, Right Now\n17 - Christmas Parodies (LP Version)\n18 - A Man And A Woman (Un Homme Et Une Femme) (LP Version)\n19 - 40 Cubic Feet (LP Version)\n20 - Lust For Life\n21 - Tomorrow\n22 - Bite Me, Doughboy!\n23 - Moon Over Parma (Main Title) (Long Version)\n24 - Cleveland Rocks\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/AanKgAADD&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/AanKgAADD&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Rocks&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Rocks&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c0428090e58ed20acd9e3210e9a31ead3e71b9d2","amp;dn":"Cleveland+Rocks+-+Music+From+The+Drew+Carey+Show+V0+mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c0428090e58ed20acd9e3210e9a31ead3e71b9d2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,66,128,144,229,142,210,10,205,158,50,16,233,163,30,173,62,113,185,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
