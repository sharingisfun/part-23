Cheremisinoff and Anton Davletshin (Wiley-Scrivener, 2010).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 9780470625828\r\n\r\nThere have been many volumes written that claim to be the most &quot;comprehensive&quot; compendium or handbook on chemical data. These wieldy volumes are often too big and extraneous to be useful to the practicing engineer. This new volume aims to be the most useful &quot;go to&quot; volume for the working engineer, scientist, or chemist who needs quick answers to daily questions about materials or chemicals and doesn't want to go on long searches through voluminous tomes or lengthy internet searches. Covering only the most commonly used chemicals in the most important processes in industry, A Guide to Safe Material and Chemical Handling includes industrial chemicals, such as gases, fuels, and water, which are not incorporated in most &quot;comprehensive&quot; books on materials and chemical properties. Safety plans and procedures that can be implemented by any engineer or plant manager by following the easy, step-by-step instructions in the book are also provided","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3bba70732b62986c51e2f374216a9039278c9561","amp;dn":"A+Guide+to+Safe+Material+and+Chemical+Handling","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3bba70732b62986c51e2f374216a9039278c9561","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,186,112,115,43,98,152,108,81,226,243,116,33,106,144,57,39,140,149,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
