Its controversial storylines have explored issues such as dysfunctional families, mental illness (such as eating disorders), adolescent sexuality, substance abuse, death and bullying. The show was created by father-and-son television writers Bryan Elsley and Jamie Brittain for Company Pictures,[1] and premiered on E4 on 25 January 2007.[2] The show went on to be a critical success as well as a ratings winner within its target demographic. Over its initial six-year run, Skins proved to be atypical of ongoing drama series in that it replaced its primary cast every two years. Plans for a film spin-off were first discussed in 2009, but ultimately did not come to fruition. Instead, a specially-commissioned seventh and final series of the show was broadcast in 2013, featuring some of the cast from its 2007Ã¢â‚¬â€œ10 run. (The show's name comes from the rolling papers known as &quot;skins&quot;.)\n\nContains All 6 Episodes of Season 7 in 1080p (WEB-DL)\n\nFile Container: MP4\nVideo Format: h.264/Mpeg4\nVideo Resolution: 1920x1080\n\nAudio Format: AAC\nAudio Language: English Stereo ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b7fa6e898a6f7ba9454353251e50a98cf543acce","amp;dn":"Skins+Season+7+%5B1080p%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b7fa6e898a6f7ba9454353251e50a98cf543acce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,250,110,137,138,111,123,169,69,67,83,37,30,80,169,140,245,67,172,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
