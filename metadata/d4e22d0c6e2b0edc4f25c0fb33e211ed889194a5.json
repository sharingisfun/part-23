It was first released in the United Kingdom on 11 September 1964 by His Master's Voice. In late October/early November, the album was released in Canada by Capitol Records. The Canadian track listing was almost the same as the UK version, except it included the hit &quot;Do Wah Diddy Diddy&quot; instead of &quot;I've Got My Mojo Working&quot;. The record has been called &quot;one of the great blues-based British invasion albums; it's a hot, rocking record that benefits from some virtuoso playing as well&quot;.\n\nThe American version of the album (their second U.S. release following The Manfred Mann Album) was released in February 1965 by Ascot Records (a subsidiary of United Artists) with a very different track listing.\n\nThe Five Faces of Manfred Mann peaked at #3 on the UK Albums Chart and is the band's highest charting release on that chart. The U.S. version also charted on the Billboard 200, peaking at #141.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n[/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d4e22d0c6e2b0edc4f25c0fb33e211ed889194a5","amp;dn":"Manfred+Mann+-+The+Five+Faces+Of++%28UK%29+%282014%29+Japan+SHMCD+FLAC+B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d4e22d0c6e2b0edc4f25c0fb33e211ed889194a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,226,45,12,110,43,14,220,79,37,192,251,51,226,17,237,136,145,148,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
