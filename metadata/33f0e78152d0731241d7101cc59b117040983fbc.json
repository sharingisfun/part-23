The band took the name from Kossoff's solo album, Back Street Crawler.The band's progress would continually be overshadowed by Kossoff's well publicised drug dependency. His reliance on narcotics was common knowledge, to such a degree that the guitarist played upon it. Ultimately, his addiction to narcotics led to his eventual demise.\nFormed in England in early 1975 by ex-Free guitarist Paul Kossoff and named after the guitaristÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 1973 solo LP, the first line up of Back Street Crawler included ex-Beckett vocalist Terry Wilson-Slessor, keyboardist Michael Montgomery, ex-Speedy Keen bassist Terry Wilson and drummer Tony Braunagel. Their debut as a band was on 1975's &quot;The Band Plays On&quot; LP but efforts to support the album's release were hampered when Kossoff suffered a major heart attack - he was clinically dead for nearly thirty minutes - brought on by his well-publicised drug addiction. He recovered sufficiently to play three concerts in November 1975 and begin to work on the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s second LP. Doctors gave him the 'all clear' in early 1976 to continue working and a major UK tour was set up for the April release of the LP &quot;Second Street&quot;However, on 19 March 1976, whilst on a flight to New York, Kossoff died in his sleep, having suffered a recurrence of heart trouble.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:33f0e78152d0731241d7101cc59b117040983fbc","amp;dn":"Back+Street+Crawler+-+2nd+Street+%281976%2F1993%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"33f0e78152d0731241d7101cc59b117040983fbc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,240,231,129,82,208,115,18,65,215,16,28,197,155,17,112,64,152,63,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
