The core group includes pianist Billy Childs and bassist Larry Klein, with either Eddie Marshall or Sinclair Lott on drums. Hubbard's take-no-prisoners attitude is apparent in a power-packed performance of his &quot;The Intrepid Fox&quot; (adding trombonist Phil Ranelin and tenor saxophonist David Schnitter), though the spotlight is on the leader, aside from a brief feature for Lott. Childs switches to Fender Rhodes for Hubbard's driving bossa nova &quot;First Light,&quot; while &quot;Happiness Is Now&quot; is a funky affair. Hubbard was underrated as a ballad interpreter, though his poignant take of Michel Legrand's &quot;The Summer Knows&quot; (from the film Summer of '42) is a brilliant showcase for him on flÃƒÂ¼gelhorn. One of the great thrills is Hubbard's first known recording of &quot;Giant Steps,&quot; with the leader tackling it with his sextet at a fast tempo, showcasing tenor saxophonist Hadley Caliman and Childs, as well. This well-packaged, previously unissued music from producer Todd Barkan's (the owner of the long defunct club) personal archives, includes detailed liner notes by several contributors and lots of period photographs.
