It is one of the most well known pieces of Nintendo DS homebrew software, and is one of the few and best ways to play video on the DS.\n\nThe player supports DPG video files, MP3 / OGG / MOD / SPC / MDX (no PCM) / GBS / HES / NSF / XM / MIDI / WMA / low bit rate AAC audio / non-progressive JPEG / BMP / GIF / PNG images, and text files. MoonShell plays fullscreen videos at 20fps and widescreen videos at 24fps, with joint stereo sound at a samplerate of 32.768 kHz. Both screens on the DS are used, with the bottom screen allowing file selection and control via touchscreen. The integrated plug-in system provides extensibility of program features. To add a feature, the plug-in files are simply copied to the appropriate folder. In order to function as a media player, several plug-in files are distributed with the software.\n\nMoonShell is included as the default multimedia player for the commercial products N-Card, R4 DS, EDGE, CycloDS, AceKard, i-cheat XTRA and M3 DS Simply. The EZFlash V Flash Card and SuperCard One has modified Moonshell source code for firmware use which can be used for booting NDS files. Another modification made for the product M3 Real is the DSM Player.\n\n\n\nThis Torrent has a self extracting File, all instructions included and is 2.08 Stable \n\n\nPlease copy 'moonshl2.nds' and '/moonshl2' folder onto the root folder of MicroSD, and start 'moonshl2.nds'.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSupport file formats.\n\nMusic formats: MP1, MP2, MP3, OGG, WAV, M4A, AAC, WMA, TTA, MID, RCP, R36\nMOD formats: MOD, IT, MTM, S3M, XM, 669, MED, STM, AMF, GDM, ULT, UNI, ASY, IMF, OKT, STX\nChiptune formats: SPC, NSF, GBS, HES, AY, SAP, KSS\nPlaylist formats: M3U, WPL\nPicture formats: JPG, BMP, GIF, PNG, PSD\nSupport DPG movie files.\nSupport text files.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLimitations concerning format.\n\nNDS: Not support commercial NDSROM files.\nWMA: Not support 'loss-less' and 'voice mode' format WMA files.\nM4A, AAC, WMA: Not support encrypted files.\nMID: Not support 'Standard MIDI file format.2' format.\nSPC: Tone quality is very bad.\nChiptune: Only the first track is performed.

Because of this, it is also possible to use a higher bitrate. People have encoded videos using 800kb/s and higher and can watch the videos without problems at all. Audio can have a higher bitrate as well.\n\nAudio\nAudio has been improved. It now fully supports MPEG-4, AAC, MP3 and WMA files.\n\nThe GUI\nThe GUI has been vastly improved and is more user-friendly. It now displays information such as the length of an audio file, and it displays the ID3 tag at the top screen using transparency so the playlist can be seen through it.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:492b97aac396b3404e5895a5b76cda8e38714508","amp;dn":"MoonShell+2.08+Stable+%5BNDS.APPS%5D+.SCOPE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"492b97aac396b3404e5895a5b76cda8e38714508","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,43,151,170,195,150,179,64,78,88,149,165,183,108,218,142,56,113,69,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
