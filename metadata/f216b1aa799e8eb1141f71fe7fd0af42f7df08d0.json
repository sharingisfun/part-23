These are the groundbreaking recordings by the first poet\nlaureate of rock n roll that set the tone lyrically and musically for all that\ncame after. To paraphrase John Lennon, if they didnt call it rock n roll,\ntheyd call it Chuck Berry music, and this remarkable new set shows why.\nDigitally remastered from the original Chess masters, the collection features\nnot only such oft-covered classics as Maybellene, Roll Over Beethoven, Rock\nAnd Roll Music, Memphis, Sweet Little Sixteen, Johnny B. Goode, Carol,\nand Little Queenie, but it also shows the evolution of the artist and his\nsongs, while presenting a surfeit of rarities, including 16 previously\nunreleased tracks.\nWith the exception of two live recordings, all of these tracks were recorded at\nChess Studios from May 21, 1955, through a massive late July 1959 session, which\nculminated in the only time Berry played session lead guitar for an artist other\nthan himself: two tracks by a studio group called the Ecuadors. Other rarities\non the set, aside from the unreleased tracks, include a pair of live versions of\nMaybellene and Roll Over Beethoven Chuck recorded for Alan Freeds 1956 New\nYork Camel Rock n Roll Dance Party album, several original masters\noverdubbed for the fake On Stage Chess album, and a number of recordings making\ntheir U.S. CD debut.\nThe unreleased recordings include take 3 of Sweet Little Sixteen, which is one\nof five versions of the song that tells the story of its recordingfrom its\ndemonstration record to two rejected (and intriguingly different) session takes\nto the original master to the sped-up master finally released by Chess. There\nare also unreleased alternate takes at different tempos than those released,\nsome with different lyrics, and one (for Broken Arrow) which features Chuck\nBerry instructing his backup singers in their parts. And, finally, there is a\npair of previously unreleased 11 minutes-plus in-studio jams featuring Chuck\nwith pianist Johnnie Johnson, bassist Willie Dixon, and drummer Jasper Thomas\na blues called Long Slow Jam and a rocker called, suitably, Long Fast Jam\nfrom 1958.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f216b1aa799e8eb1141f71fe7fd0af42f7df08d0","amp;dn":"Chuck+Berry+-+His+Complete+50s+Chess+Recordings+-%5B2008%5D-%5B4CD%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f216b1aa799e8eb1141f71fe7fd0af42f7df08d0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,22,177,170,121,158,142,177,20,31,113,254,127,208,175,66,247,223,8,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
