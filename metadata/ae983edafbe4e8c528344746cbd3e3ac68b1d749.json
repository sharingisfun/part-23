Wolverine is a mutant, possessing animal-keen senses, enhanced psychical \ncapabilities, three retracting bone claws on each hand and a healing factor that allows him \nto recover from virtually any wound, disease or toxin at a accelerated rate\n\n------------------------------------------\n\n[b]Wolverine[/b]\n================\n\nNo.  Title \tOriginal airdate   English airdate\n---- -------  ------------------- -----------------\n\n04 &quot;Omega Red&quot; August 19, 2011\n(ÃƒÂ¦Ã‚Â¥Ã‚ÂµÃƒÂ¨Ã‚ÂµÃ‚Â¤)  January 28, 2011\n\nLogan's fight with Omega Red takes its toll on him regardless of his healing factor. \nIn a flashback of one of Logan's black ops missions, he was to infiltrate and steal \na power source for a Soviet era weapon, which drains the life force of any weapon it \ntouches with its carbonadium tendrils, which are a KGB experimental counterpart to adamantium.\n As Logan steals the power source, he runs into Omega Red and leaves him to die in a cave in the snow. \nIn present day, Omega Red blames Wolverine for his pain because without the synthesizer, \nhis body was vulnerable to biological attack. To buy time and escape, Logan throws a flammable container \nat Omega Red which explodes and destroys the dock. While resting in a vacant apartment, \nWolverine senses an assassin. The assassin is really a decoy for Omega Red, who reappears with a \nseverely burnt face, and pins Logan to the wall and knocks Yukio back.  \n \nSpoken Language: English\n-------------------------------------------\n\nScreens:\n---------\n[URL=http://img593.imageshack.us/i/wolverine104omegaredoja.jpg/][IMG]http://img593.imageshack.us/img593/1192/wolverine104omegaredoja.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n-----------------------------------------\n\n              ===== File Info ===== \nFileSize           : 175M\nPlayTime           : 00:23:32.45\nVideoCount         : 1\nAudioCount         : 1\n              ===== Video Info ===== \nVideo 0# Stream\nVideoCodec         : XVID\nVideoWidth         : 720 piexs\nVideoHeight        : 420 piexs\nVideoFrameRate     : 29.970fps\nVideoFrameCount    : 42319\nVideoBitRate       : 904054\n              ===== Audio Info ===== \nAudio 0# Stream\nAudioCodec         : MP3\nAudioBitRate       : 128000\nAudioChannels      : 2\nAudioSampleRate    : 44100\n\nFormat: Avi\n\n-------------------------------------\n\nHash:\n------\nAE983EDAFBE4E8C528344746CBD3E3AC68B1D749\n--------------------------------\n[/center]\n\nJoin us at #Cartoon_Palace onfor more Cartoons and Anime.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae983edafbe4e8c528344746cbd3e3ac68b1d749","amp;dn":"Wolverine+-+104+-+Omega+Red+%5BOj%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae983edafbe4e8c528344746cbd3e3ac68b1d749","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,152,62,218,251,228,232,197,40,52,71,70,203,211,227,172,104,177,215,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
