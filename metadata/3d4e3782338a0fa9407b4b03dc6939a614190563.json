The album was released in 1986.\n\nAfter receiving her own MTV New Year's Eve special, Jett beat out a number of contenders to appear in the movie Light of Day with Michael J. Fox. Bruce Springsteen wrote &quot;the title song&quot; especially for her, and her performance was critically acclaimed. It was about this time that Ryan and Crystal left the Blackhearts. They were soon replaced by the powerful rhythm section of Thommy Price and Kasim Sulton. Later that year, Jett released Good Music, which featured appearances by The Beach Boys, The Sugarhill Gang and singer Darlene Love.\n\nJoan Jett (born Joan Marie Larkin September 22, 1958, in Wynnewood, Pennsylvania) is an American rock guitarist, singer, songwriter, producer and actress.\n\nShe is best known for her hit cover &quot;I Love Rock N' Roll&quot;, which was #1 on the Billboard charts from March 20 to May 1, 1982, as well as for her other popular recordings including &quot;Crimson and Clover&quot;, &quot;Do You Want to Touch Me&quot;, &quot;Light of Day&quot;, &quot;Love is All Around&quot;, &quot;Bad Reputation,&quot; &quot;I Hate Myself for Loving You,&quot; and &quot;Little Liar.&quot;\n\nJett has a mezzo-soprano vocal range. Her musical and song-writing approach is heavily influenced by the hard-edged, hard beat-driven rhythms common to many rock bands of her native Philadelphia, often featuring lyrics surrounding themes of lost love, criticisms of insincerity, the struggles and resolution of the American working class, and the quest for authenticity.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d4e3782338a0fa9407b4b03dc6939a614190563","amp;dn":"Joan+Jett+-+Good+Music","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d4e3782338a0fa9407b4b03dc6939a614190563","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,78,55,130,51,138,15,169,64,123,75,3,220,105,57,166,20,25,5,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
