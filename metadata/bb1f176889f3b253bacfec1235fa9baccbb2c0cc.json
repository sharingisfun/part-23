There is another theory which states that this has already happened. - Douglas Adams\n\n* When we remember we are all mad, the mysteries disappear and life stands explained. - Mark Twain\n\n* Anger will never disappear so long as thoughts of resentment are cherished in the mind. Anger will disappear just as soon as thoughts of resentment are forgotten. - Buddha\n\n\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disappear_(INXS_song)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disappear_(INXS_song)&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/aacfPaadG&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/aacfPaadG&lt;/a&gt; \n   \n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:     \n   Video: MPEG2 Video 768x576 25.00fps 6001kbps\n   Audio: Dolby Digital AC3 48000Hz 6ch 448kbps\n   Duration: 00:04:07\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
