I can hear his voice clearly on a few tracks  including the Beauitful Day  song &quot;aquarian dream&quot;. The 1st track bulgaria is a dramatically different version than what is found on their first LP. \nThe band Tripsichord previously was the Ban (brent records) and then the Now (on embassy) to finally come into maturity with Tripsichord Music Box.\n\n________________________________________________________________\nrecorded to digital from original VINYL PRESSING\n\n24K (bits)  shared in ALAC package \n\n\nfiles included in original freqazoidiac package (please keep integral)\n\n\nTechnics 1200mkII modified to audiophile standard\nAudioTechnica 150series MM cartridge \nmackie u.420d firewire 24/96 mixer\nMac G4 dual mirror door\nOSX 10.6.8\nTC Spark XL","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f1bc2d951ead4316f52b9c8fc6f0ab078ba489c3","amp;dn":"fifth+pipe+dream-san+francisco+sound-1968-24K-ALAC-freQazoidiac","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f1bc2d951ead4316f52b9c8fc6f0ab078ba489c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,188,45,149,30,173,67,22,245,43,156,143,198,240,171,7,139,164,137,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
