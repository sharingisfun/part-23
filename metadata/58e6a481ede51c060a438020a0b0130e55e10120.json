There is only so much you can do in 24 hours and lets be honest with ourselves, are we really using time efficiently? How many hours go by that we waste everyday, producing literally nothing. Imagine what you could've done with all those hours you spent doing nothing, how much money you could've made, how many friends you could've had, how much time you could've spent with your family, how many vacation trips you could've had. \r\n\r\nIf there is one thing that I've seen the modern generation run short of, is time. Why does it always seem that there just isn't enough time in the 24 hours that God gifted us with. For some reason, just when we think we freed up enough time to do some leisure activity, something just has to come up. \r\n\r\nIâ€™ll tell you, the answer to that isn't so complicated. People make things too complicated and thatâ€™s where the problem lies. When you donâ€™t keep track of your time or schedule it properly, everything feels very very cluttered! And when things start getting cluttered, we feel like everything is just going to implode in our brain. \r\n\r\nThis is what this book addresses. I know many people have so much going on in their lives that they don't have time to make for themselves, and there are others who have all the time in the world yet don't utilize it. This book addresses both types of people. \r\n\r\nHow Will Time Management Help You\r\n\r\nTÑ–mÐµ MÐ°nÐ°gÐµmÐµnt Ñ–Ñ• a Ñ•Ðµt Ð¾f tÐ¾Ð¾lÑ• whÑ–Ñh Ð°llÐ¾wÑ• uÑ• tÐ¾: \r\n\r\n(i) Eliminate wÐ°Ñ•tÐµ \r\n(Ñ–Ñ–) BÐµ Ñ€rÐµÑ€Ð°rÐµd fÐ¾r meetings \r\n(Ñ–Ñ–Ñ–) RÐµduÑÐµ ÐµxÑÐµÑ•Ñ•Ñ–vÐµ workload \r\n(Ñ–v) MÐ¾nÑ–tÐ¾r Ñ€rÐ¾jÐµÑt progress \r\n(v) AllÐ¾ÑÐ°tÐµ resource (tÑ–mÐµ) Ð°Ñ€Ñ€rÐ¾Ñ€rÑ–Ð°tÐµlÑƒ tÐ¾ tÐ°Ñ•kÑ•. \r\n(vi) Ensure that long term Ñ€rÐ¾jÐµÑtÑ• Ð°rÐµ nÐ¾t nÐµglÐµÑtÐµd \r\n(vÑ–Ñ–) PlÐ°n each day ÐµffÐµÑtÑ–vÐµlÑƒ \r\n(vÑ–Ñ–Ñ–) PlÐ°n each wÐµÐµk ÐµffÐµÑtÑ–vÐµlÑƒ Ð°nd tÐ¾ do Ñ•Ð¾ with lÑ–ttlÐµ Ñ•Ðµlf-dÑ–Ñ•ÑÑ–Ñ€lÑ–nÐµ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:58e6a481ede51c060a438020a0b0130e55e10120","amp;dn":"Mastering+Your+Time%3A+The+Art+Of+Getting+Things+Done+Quickly+And+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"58e6a481ede51c060a438020a0b0130e55e10120","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,230,164,129,237,229,28,6,10,67,128,32,160,176,19,14,85,225,1,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
