The story he reads follows two young lovers named Allie Hamilton and Noah Calhoun. They met one evening at a carnival many years ago. Allie&amp;#039;s parents separate Noah and Allie. They disapprove of Noah&amp;#039;s lack of wealth, and move Allie away. After waiting for Noah to write her for several years, Allie meets and becomes engaged to a handsome young soldier named Lon. In a local newspaper, Noah&amp;#039;s picture catches Allie&amp;#039;s eye. He is standing in front of a fully restored, 200 year old home. The article is filled with praise for his accomplishments. Allie&amp;#039;s heart nearly bursts. The last time she saw this house it was a rotted decaying shamble. She stood enfolded in Noah&amp;#039;s arms in the great entryway and listened to his plans to buy and restore this house. Just the way she wanted it. With her love for Noah still alive, the picture pulls at her heart. She has to go back, see if Noah is okay, and tell him about her marriage. They both think the echo deep in their hearts, the one that has lasted all these years, is not shared by the other. The cry they could not stifle. It wasn&amp;#039;t over for me.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4162b35dbfc12cf567c56ce2ae3a6cf30128070","amp;dn":"The+Notebook+2004+PROPER+XviD+AC3-WAF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4162b35dbfc12cf567c56ce2ae3a6cf30128070","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,22,43,53,219,252,18,207,86,124,86,206,42,227,166,207,48,18,128,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
