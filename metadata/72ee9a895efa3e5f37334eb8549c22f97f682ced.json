It will allow you to:\n\n-Understand different planning problems\n-Have the basic know how to design and implement AI planning systems\n-Know how to use AI planning technology for projects in different application domains\n-Have the ability to make use of AI planning literature\n\nPlanning is a fundamental part of intelligent systems. In this course, for example, you will learn the basic algorithms that are used in robots to deliberate over a course of actions to take. Simpler, reactive robots don't need this, but if a robot is to act intelligently, this type of reasoning about actions is vital.\n\nMore information about this course available at https://www.coursera.org/course/aiplan","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:72ee9a895efa3e5f37334eb8549c22f97f682ced","amp;dn":"%5BCoursera%5D+Artificial+Intelligence+Planning","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"72ee9a895efa3e5f37334eb8549c22f97f682ced","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,238,154,137,94,250,62,95,55,51,78,184,84,156,34,249,127,104,44,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
