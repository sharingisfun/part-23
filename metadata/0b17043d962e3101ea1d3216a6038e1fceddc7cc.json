Bush seized power with the complicity of the Supreme Court and despite electoral results that were against him ; a global citizensurveillance system was set up through the USA Patriot Act ; the Army was allowed to intervene in domestic policy ; a propaganda machine was set up ; the country abdicated its right to self-rule and has launched itself into a series of colonial campaigns in Afghanistan and Iraq. What we are witnessing is not simply a change in policies but the emergence of a new regime that threatens Liberty in America and Peace in the rest of the world.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b17043d962e3101ea1d3216a6038e1fceddc7cc","amp;dn":"The+Bush+Regime+Card+Deck+%28The+52+Most+Dangerous+American+Dignit","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b17043d962e3101ea1d3216a6038e1fceddc7cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,23,4,61,150,46,49,1,234,29,50,22,166,3,142,31,206,221,199,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
