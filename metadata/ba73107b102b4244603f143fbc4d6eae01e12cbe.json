This eccentric, risk-taking band (not to be confused with the late-'70s disco group Space) doesn't take itself too seriously, and brings an enjoyably twisted sense of humor to such goofy numbers as &quot;Female of the Species&quot; (an ode to a lover who practices witchcraft), &quot;Mr. Psycho,&quot; and &quot;Voodoo Roller.&quot; Space's inspirations range from hip-hop to brooding East European folk, which is incorporated with inspired results on &quot;Money&quot; and &quot;Lovechild of the Queen.&quot; To be sure, the rockers can be overly self-indulgent, but like Frank Zappa and George Clinton, generally use their eccentricity advantageously.
