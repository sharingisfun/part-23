Clearly, something is amiss. Miss Lemon, on questioning, reveals that she is worried about her sister, Mrs. Hubbard. After spending her married life in Singapore, Mrs. Hubbard has returned to England a widow, where she is living as matron of a youth hostel in Hickory Road, an establishment that caters to an international group of students. It seems that things, &quot;odd things,&quot; have been disappearing from the hostel, &quot;And all in rather an unnatural way.&quot; Miss Lemon suspects it&amp;#039;s something more than petty thievery or kleptomania, and Poirot agrees to meet Felicity Lemon&amp;#039;s distressed sibling.\n\nPlease seed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e9f39ce2819f57c9413f1df9644d4e0bf2dc95d","amp;dn":"Hickory+Dickory+Dock+by+Agatha+Christie+a+Poirot+Audiobook+64kbp","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e9f39ce2819f57c9413f1df9644d4e0bf2dc95d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,159,57,206,40,25,245,124,148,19,241,223,150,68,212,224,191,45,201,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
