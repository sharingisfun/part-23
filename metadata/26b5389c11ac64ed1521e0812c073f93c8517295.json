British and American involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan has highlighted this form of conflict in the modern world. Armies, sometimes reluctantly, have had to adopt new doctrines and tactics to deal with the problems of insurgency and diverse counterinsurgency strategies have been developed, ranging from conventional operations to a combination of propaganda and political strategy. Here, 13 authors examine the development of counterinsurgency from the early 20th century to the present. Including information on the Arab-Israeli conflict, Afghanistan and Iraq this book is a timely and accessible survey of a critical facet of modern warfare.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:26b5389c11ac64ed1521e0812c073f93c8517295","amp;dn":"Counterinsurgency+in+Modern+Warfare","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"26b5389c11ac64ed1521e0812c073f93c8517295","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,181,56,156,17,172,100,237,21,33,224,129,44,7,63,147,200,81,114,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
