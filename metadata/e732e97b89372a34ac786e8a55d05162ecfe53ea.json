Hailing from California, Wreck and Reference are infusing heavy, doom-esque moments into otherwise spacious and hypnotic tracks. The track ÃƒÂ´NauseaÃƒÂ¶ even showcases some loud and mechanically delivered black metal-style blast beats.\n\nNo Youth sets a very specific mood, but utilizes a variety of percussion, and a large range of intensity to stand out amidst its peers. The album was even mixed and mastered by Colin Marson of Krallice, which definitely gives the album somewhat of a seal of approval in some circlesÃƒÂ»this being one of them.\n\nRecorded by W&amp;R in the Howling Wasteland, CA. Mixed and mastered by Colin Marston at Menegroth, the Thousand Caves. Photography by Brandon Gehres. Depicted: Walter Karl Marcus.\n\nTrack Listing:\n\n01. Spectrum  (04:18), 9.97 MB\n02.
