Four of the six numbers (all but &quot;Nena&quot; and &quot;Advantage&quot;) were previously recorded by the pacesetting fusion guitarist. With strong and stimulating contributions made by keyboardist Jan Hammer, electric bassist Anthony Jackson, drummer Steve Gadd, percussionist Mingo Lewis, and second keyboardist Victor Godsey (some additional keyboards and percussion were overdubbed later in the studio), di Meola is typically stunning on such originals as &quot;Elegant Gypsy Suite&quot; and &quot;Race with Devil on Spanish Highway.&quot; \n\n\nRelease Date\nFebruary 4, 1982 \n\nDuration\n39:14 \n\nGenre\nJazz\nPop/Rock\nStyles\nFusion\nGuitar Virtuoso\nJazz-Rock\nGuitar Jazz\nJazz Instrument\n\n\nRecording Date\nFebruary 4, 1982\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b6eed2e15b0e44ab13036915010f84baa57b9018","amp;dn":"1982-+Al+Di+Meola-+Tour+De+force%28Live%29+24bit-192khz+sidmal","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b6eed2e15b0e44ab13036915010f84baa57b9018","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,238,210,225,91,14,68,171,19,3,105,21,1,15,132,186,165,123,144,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
