The products covered here are a curious mix, including automobiles, blue jeans, chewing gum, jet engines, microwave ovens, pantyhose, salsa, stainless steel, tortilla chips, and zippers. Ranging from four to seven pages, each entry includes the product's description, history, design, manufacturing process, raw materials, by-products, future uses, and a bibliography. The text is nontechnical, and the illustrations are clear, making this book appropriate for YAs as well as adult lay readers. The entries are generally adequate, though some are extremely brief; one can only hope that, as future volumes are compiled, the editor will choose products whose manufacture can be successfully described in a brief space. All in all, however, this is a useful reference tool for school, public, and undergraduate collections.\n\nPublisher: Gale (October 30, 1995)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0810389525\nISBN-13: 978-0810389526\n\nPublisher: Gale (October 29, 1997)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0787615471\nISBN-13: 978-0787615475\n\nPublisher: Gale (September 30, 1998)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0787624438\nISBN-13: 978-0787624439\n\nPublisher: Gale (September 21, 1999)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0787624446\nISBN-13: 978-0787624446\n\nPublisher: Gale (April 10, 2001)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0787636428\nISBN-13: 978-0787636425\n\nPublisher: Gale; 1 edition (March 21, 2002)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0787636436\nISBN-13: 978-0787636432","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9c7d3b6dd1de5685c592f06bd07a0a516bec38b8","amp;dn":"How+Products+Are+Made+-+Vol+1-7+Pdf+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9c7d3b6dd1de5685c592f06bd07a0a516bec38b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,125,59,109,209,222,86,133,197,146,240,107,208,122,10,81,107,236,56,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
