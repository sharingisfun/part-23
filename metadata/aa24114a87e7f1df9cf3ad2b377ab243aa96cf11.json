Many species of alien creatures (often humanoid) are depicted. Robotic droids are also commonplace and are generally built to serve their owners. Space travel is common, and many planets in the galaxy are members of a Galactic Republic, later reorganized as the Galactic Empire.\nOne of the prominent elements of Star Wars is the &quot;Force&quot;, an omnipresent energy that can be harnessed by those with that ability. It is described in the first produced film as &quot;an energy field created by all living things [that] surrounds us, penetrates us, [and] binds the galaxy together.&quot;[3] The Force allows users to perform a variety of supernatural feats (such as telekinesis, clairvoyance, precognition, and mind control) and also can amplify certain physical traits, such as speed and reflexes; these abilities vary between characters and can be improved through training. While the Force can be used for good, it has a dark side that, when pursued, imbues users with hatred, aggression, and malevolence. The six films feature the Jedi, who use the Force for good, and the Sith, who use the dark side for evil in an attempt to take over the galaxy. In the Star Wars Expanded Universe, many dark side users are Dark Jedi rather than Sith, mainly because of the &quot;Rule of Two&quot; (see Sith Origin).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa24114a87e7f1df9cf3ad2b377ab243aa96cf11","amp;dn":"Star.Wars.Episodes.Complete.1080p.HDTV.x264-helge32","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa24114a87e7f1df9cf3ad2b377ab243aa96cf11","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,36,17,74,135,231,241,223,156,243,173,43,55,122,178,67,170,150,207,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
