I have searched for the best, smallest, most complete versions available. Nearly all books are PDF but there are a few RARs (where I wanted to keep several books together) and a couple EXE cookbooks. All names have been corrected and those with no Table of Contents are noted. \n\nUsually when I upload an updated torrent I delete the previous one but this time I'll leave it on TPB for awhile because it still has many seeders and, if you have downloaded the previous torrent, you may want to compare it to this one and see what has changed. It also contains a lot of comments about what others thought of my previous torrent especially the two EXE cookbooks. Interesting read. That torrent is located here.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4034097&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4034097&lt;/a&gt;\n\nNumber of cookbooks in this torrent:\n\nGeneral cookbooks - 256\nCooking the (insert country here) Way - 35\nCopycat, Insiders, Restaurant, Secret - 13\nFood of the World - 9\n\nTried to put the whole list here but TPB would not accept it, guess it was too long.
