Compared to two cd players and my car stereo. You \n   can also very slightly hear it in the shitty myspace album stream.\n\n   For years, Dillinger Escape Plan have been the metal standard-bearers of\n   dizzying, time-signature torture, though they have occasionally eased up to\n   construct NIN-damaged, alt-rock superhero fantasies. The band's fourth album\n   gives these two personalities their most seamless marriage to date, as\n   aggro-prog headfucks roar with the anthemic crush-and-croon of late-period\n   Faith No More. &quot;Widower&quot; is a beautiful, early-Lollapalooza-era treat,\n   featuring Bowie's Aladdin Sane pianist Mike Garson, who helps push the vocal\n   cords of sensitive-to-seething-to-soaring frontman Greg Puciato to the\n   harrowing edge.\n\n- Track List ---------------------------------------------------------------- -\n\n  01.
