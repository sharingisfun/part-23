Recording sessions for the album took place at various recording locations and began in November 2010. It was produced by West, 88 Keys, RZA, Swizz Beatz, Jeff Bhasker, and Mike Dean, among others. Expanding on the dense production style of West\\'s 2010 album My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, Watch the Throne incorporates orchestral and progressive rock influences, unconventional samples, and dramatic melodies in its sound. Jay-Z and West\\'s braggadocio lyrics on the album exhibit themes of opulence, fame, materialism, power, and the burdens of success, as well as political and socioeconomic context.\n\nTrack listing\nNo. \tTitle \tWriter(s) \tProducer(s) \tLength\n1. \t\\&quot;No Church in the Wild\\&quot; (featuring Frank Ocean) \tKanye West, Shawn Carter, Charles Njapa, Michael Dean, Christopher Breaux, Terius Nash, Gary Wright, Phil Manzanera, James Brown, Joseph Roach \t88-Keys, Kanye West, Mike Dean \t4:32\n2. \t\\&quot;Lift Off\\&quot; (featuring BeyoncÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©) \tWest, Carter, Jeff Bhasker, M.
