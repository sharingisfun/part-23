Young Freud in Gaza follows him over the course of two years. This is a turbulent part of the world: suicide attacks, demonstrations and armed combat are the order of the day. In Ayed's own words, &quot;We need a million psychologists in Gaza.&quot; The inhabitants of the Gaza Strip are constantly confronted with violence, and this has its repercussions on their mental health.\n\nEach day, Ayed receives clients in his office and makes house calls to those in need. One young girl is struggling with an eating disorder; another woman saw her husband get killed with her own eyes. Ayed provides therapy to Hamas militants who narrowly escaped attacks and listens to the stories of a group of kids who lost their family members to violence. In all the sessions, the goal is to regain a sense of security, and it can be tough going for the therapist as well.\n\nWhen Ayed bears witness to fights between the competing movements of Hamas and Fatah, in which Palestinians fight against each other, he's deeply disappointed. For a while, it's no easy task for him to remain motivated and optimistic.\n\nNote: The DVD from which this rip was sourced had hardsubbed subtitles for the parts with non-english dialog. There was no way for me to separate the subtitles from the video. \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPuts a human face on the travails of daily life in Gaza... a compelling and disturbing glimpse of the human toll of an occupation lived daily.
