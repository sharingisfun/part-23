Most begin by buying a modest astronomical telescope and getting to know the night sky. After a while, many want to move on to the next stage, but this can be problematic. The magazines advertise a mass of commercially-made equipment ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ some of it very expensive ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ which can represent a major financial outlay. The trick is to choose the right equipment, and then use it to its fullest extent.\n\nObserving Skills: The Science and Art of using Astronomical Telescopes provides the required information. First, it explains how to get the best from entry-level equipment (that upgrade may not even be needed for a year or two!). Second, it explains how to select equipment that is at the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“next levelÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, and describes how use more advanced telescopes and accessories.\n\nThe book is organized according to observational targets, and although it concentrates mainly on visual observing, it concludes with a section on imaging and the equipment currently available ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ from regular digital cameras, through webcams, to specialized chilled-chip CCD cameras.\nObserving Skills: The Science and Art of using Astronomical Telescopes is the perfect follow-up to Moore and Watson: Astronomy with a Budget Telescope and Tonkin: AstroFAQs . It neatly fills the gap between these introductory books and the more advanced books in SpringerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Practical Astronomy list.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a40923c7f1e7a9170c0d9595944b9c1a4a253a27","amp;dn":"The+Science+and+Art+of+Using+Telescopes-viny","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a40923c7f1e7a9170c0d9595944b9c1a4a253a27","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,9,35,199,241,231,169,23,12,13,149,149,148,75,156,26,74,37,58,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
