At her autumnal best, Holiday particularly shines on &quot;Good Morning Heartache,&quot; &quot;Yesterdays,&quot; and &quot;Speak Low.&quot; The disc also spotlights the stellar playing of Harry &quot;Sweets&quot; Edison, Tony Scott, Ben Webster, Jimmy Rowles, and Barney Kessel. For fans already familiar with Holiday's earlier and more popular Columbia sides, this generous and commendable collection makes for the perfect introduction to her more pathos-rich later work. ~ Stephen Cook, All Music Guide\n\nOn first listening to this CD, I agreed with the liner notes. Billie was past her prime, her voice reduced to a shadow of its former self. On second, third, fourth, and thousandth listen I began to understand her particular magic. Whether projecting pure golden affection on tunes like &quot;P.S. I love You,&quot; biting pain on &quot;Good Morning Heathache,&quot; or playful flirtation on &quot;A Fine Romance,&quot; Billie was a true past master of both song and emotion. &quot;God Bless the Child,&quot; a tune she wrote herself, is a wonder, ironic and bitter and melodious and moving all at once. Buy this CD, and don't stop at one listen. Lady Day is the real thing.  ~ Dan in Bombay\n\nVerve Jazz Masters 12 - Billie Holiday Tracks:\n01  What A Little Moonlight Can Do 3:14 \n02  P.S.
