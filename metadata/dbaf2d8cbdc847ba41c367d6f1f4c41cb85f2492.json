Back for good? lets hope so!\n\nProgress is Take That's sixth studio album, and the first to feature the full line up of Gary Barlow, Mark Owen, Howard Donald, Jason Orange and Robbie Williams since 1995's Somebody Else. The album features the single &quot;The Flood&quot;\n\n[IMG]http://i896.photobucket.com/albums/ac169/pbf99/tr.gif[/IMG]\n\n   1. The Flood\n   2. SOS\n   3. Wait\n   4. Kidz\n   5.
