The trek also puts an end to the band's search for a permanent drummer, with Bay Area's Alex Bent now firmly in place behind the kit. \nAfter performing with the band on two headlining tours in 2014 and a trip to South America, Alex officially joined and tracked drums for the new album.\n\n&quot;Rise to Power&quot; track listing:\n\n01.
