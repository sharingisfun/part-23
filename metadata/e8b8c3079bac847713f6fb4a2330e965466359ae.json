There are no lyrics or voices, save for the occasional chorus synthesizer. According to the director\\'s comments on DVD 2 (see below), most instrument sounds are generated with software synthesizers on a music workstation. Many sounds resemble stock patches available on digital keyboards, subjected to some manipulation, such as pitch or playback speed, to enhance the appeal of their timbre.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e8b8c3079bac847713f6fb4a2330e965466359ae","amp;dn":"Animusic+1+%2B+2+Soundtrack+-+320kbps+mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e8b8c3079bac847713f6fb4a2330e965466359ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,184,195,7,155,172,132,119,19,246,251,74,35,48,233,101,70,99,89,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
