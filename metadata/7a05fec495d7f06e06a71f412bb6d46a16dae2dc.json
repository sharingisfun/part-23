ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s called Sumerian Ceremonials: Florence + The Sphinx, and in case the name didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t give it away, it consists primarily of songs from Florence + The MachineÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 2011 album, Ceremonials. Of course, one exception has been made Ã¢â‚¬â€ Stick To Your Guns have recorded Ã¢â‚¬Å“Dog Days Are Over,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ because you canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t really release a Florence + The Machine tribute album and not include the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s big breakthrough hit.\nANYWAY, I think this is actually a pretty cool idea; mostly, I just wish that my favorite song from Ceremonials, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Seven Devils,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ was being performed by a band whose work I enjoy more (sorry, BOO fans). What happened? The Faceless were too busy? The Faceless could have KILLED that song.\nHereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the full track listing, courtesy of The PRPÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n01 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Periphery Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Only If For A NightÃ¢â‚¬Å“\n02 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Stick To Your Guns Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Dog Days Are OverÃ¢â‚¬Å“\n03 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ben Bruce (Asking Alexandria) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Shake It OutÃ¢â‚¬Å“\n04 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Darkest Hour Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ã¢â‚¬Å“SpectrumÃ¢â‚¬Å“\n05 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Miss Fortune Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ã¢â‚¬Å“No Light, No LightÃ¢â‚¬Å“\n06 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Fever Dreamer Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Leave My BodyÃ¢â‚¬Å“\n07 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Born of Osiris Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Seven DevilsÃ¢â‚¬Å“\n08 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Come the Dawn Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ã¢â‚¬Å“What The Water Gave MeÃ¢â‚¬Å“\n09 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Upon A Burning Body Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Lover To LoverÃ¢â‚¬Å“\n10 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Mike Semesky (Intervals/Raunchy) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ã¢â‚¬Å“HeartlinesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (feat.
