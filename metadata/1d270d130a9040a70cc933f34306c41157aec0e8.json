Destroy it!\nYou have an absolute freedom in how you achieve your goal; there are no corridors, no fixed paths to fly, just an open, living world\nOverview:\nYou're flying just feet above real landscapes. There's a dragon in front of you, killer crabs behind and some guy on another carpet cutting you to ribbons. Not enough mana for the accelerate spell. Looks like you're gonna have to fight this one out, then. Shred the skies on the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fastest, most heavily armed flying carpet. Duel rival wizards and wade into hordes of deadly beasts in your quest to restore 50 shattered worlds. At your disposal is an impressive arsenal of devastating spells. Summon lighting storms, meteors, raise the dead to fight for you and, of course, cast the classic fireball spell, and that is only the beginning!\n\nThe terrain is fully deformable so if you suddenly have an unresistable felling that those peaceful and green fields need more fire, death, and thundering volcanoes, there is nothing that stands in your way! Yes, Magic Carpet, Bullfrog's extraordinary flying action-shooter, gives you all the power a wizard could ever wish for!\n\n-------------\n\nIF YOU HAVE ANY REQUESTS, PLEASE WRITE THEM IN COMMENTS, ENJOY AND DON'T FORGET TO SEED IT BACK.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d270d130a9040a70cc933f34306c41157aec0e8","amp;dn":"Magic+Carpet+%5BGoG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d270d130a9040a70cc933f34306c41157aec0e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,39,13,19,10,144,64,167,12,201,51,243,67,6,196,17,87,174,192,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
