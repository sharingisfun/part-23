It includes a quick-start tutorial, an automatic script writer (macro recorder) that records your keystrokes and mouse clicks, and a comprehensive help file.\n\nIn addition to its automation features described below, AutoHotkey excels at hotkeys, able to make almost *any* mouse/joystick button, keyboard key, or combination into a hotkey. It can also individually disable or override WindowsÃ‚Â´ own shortcut keys, such as Win+E and Win+R. It may also help alleviate RSI; for example, it can create substitutes for Alt-Tab using keys, mouse wheel, or buttons.\n\nMAJOR AUTOMATION FEATURES\n\n* Define abbreviations that expand as you type them (auto-replace).\n* Create custom GUI windows and menu bars.\n* Retrieve or change the volume, mute, and other settings of any soundcard.\n* Remap keys and mouse/joystick buttons.\n* Send keystrokes and mouse clicks to any window (without needing to activate it).\n* Launch programs, shortcuts, URLs, and documents.\n* Activate, hide, close, or resize any window.\n* Make a window transparent and/or always-on-top.\n* Change the priority of a process or close it.\n* Create custom tray icon menus and popup menus.\n* Use a joystick as a mouse.\n* Monitor your system (e.g. close unwanted windows the moment they appear).\n* Automate game actions by detecting pixel colors.\n* Retrieve and change the clipboardÃ‚Â´s contents, even if it contains files copied from the Explorer.\n* Perform any operation upon a set of files and folders that match a wildcard pattern.\n* Read, write, and parse text files more easily than in most other languages.\n* Work with the registry and INI files using the included interface commands.\n* Display simple tooltips and balloon tips.\n* Display dialog boxes to interact with the user.\n* Convert any script into an EXE that can be run on any computer.\n\n_ _\n| | | | _ _\n| | _____ ____ _____| | _| |_ ___ ____ ____ _____ ____ _| |_ ___\n| || ___ |/ _ (____ | | (_ _) _  / ___) ___) ___ | _ (_ _)/___)\n| || ____( (_| / ___ | | | || |_| | | | | | ____| | | || |_|___ |\n_)_____)___ _____|_) __)___/|_| |_| |_____)_| |_| __|___/\n(_____|\n\n\n-LEGAL TORRENTS\n\nPurpose:\n\ncreate a balance, share the already free stuff,\npublic domain works, freeware, free music,\nfree ebooks, articles, manifestos, movie trailers, and more.\n\nshow the copyright owners that torrent\nwebsites shouldn&amp;#039;t bear the responsibility\nof what their users upload, torrent websites\nare very much similar to google..\n\nusers upload what they want to upload,\ndownload what they want to download,\nand search for what they want to search..\n\nby creating this balance and sharing the already free\nstuff, we hope to take the pressure of torrent websites..\n\n_ _\n| | | | _ _\n| | _____ ____ _____| | _| |_ ___ ____ ____ _____ ____ _| |_ ___\n| || ___ |/ _ (____ | | (_ _) _  / ___) ___) ___ | _ (_ _)/___)\n| || ____( (_| / ___ | | | || |_| | | | | | ____| | | || |_|___ |\n_)_____)___ _____|_) __)___/|_| |_| |_____)_| |_| __|___/\n(_____| ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f640dd1db09e7009d0dd0cc735f5ad718ed4263","amp;dn":"AutoHotkey+1.0.47.03+-LegalTorrents","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8f640dd1db09e7009d0dd0cc735f5ad718ed4263","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,100,13,209,219,9,231,0,157,13,208,204,115,95,90,215,24,237,66,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
