This isn't the best remembered of it's kind but it seems to have gathered a dedicated fan base.\n\n108 issues published by DC 1952-1968\n\nThe Fox and the Crow starred in comic books, where they starred in several funny animal comics published by DC Comics, from the 1940s well into the 1960s. They starred with other characters in DC's Columbia-licensed funny animal anthology Real Screen Comics (first issue titled Real Screen Funnies) beginning in 1945, then did likewise when DC converted the superhero title Comic Cavalcade to a funny-animal series in 1948.\nThe duo received its own title, The Fox and the Crow, which ran 108 issues (Jan. 1952 - March 1968). Until the 1954 demise of Comic Cavalcade, Fox and Crow were cover-featured on three DC titles. They continued on the cover of Real Screen Comics through its title change to TV Screen Cartoons from #129-138 (Aug. 1959 - Feb. 1961), the final issue.\nThe Fox and the Crow itself was renamed Stanley and His Monster beginning with #109 (May 1968), after the back-up feature, begun in #95 (Jan. 1966), that had taken over in popularity. For the last ten years of its existence, The Fox and the Crow was written by Cecil Beard, assisted by his wife, Alpine Harper. The illustrator was Jim Davis (b. 1915), although it was generally unsigned.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c0e4c5154d37200aedc0d91750a35b6534cf88fd","amp;dn":"The+Fox+and+The+Crow+%23+1-108+%28DC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c0e4c5154d37200aedc0d91750a35b6534cf88fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,228,197,21,77,55,32,10,237,192,217,23,80,163,91,101,52,207,136,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
