PJ Harvey's second album, 'Rid of Me,' finds the trio, and Harvey in particular, pushing themselves to extremes. This is partially due to producer Steve Albini, who gives the album a bloodless, abrasive edge with his exacting production; each dynamic is pushed to the limit, leaving absolutely no subtleties in the music. Harvey's songs, in decided contrast to Albini's approach, are filled with gray areas and uncertainties, and are considerably more personal than those on 'Dry.' Furthermore, they are lyrically and melodically superior to the songs on the debut, but their merits are obscured by Albini's black-and-white production, which is polarizing. It may be the aural embodiment of the tortured lyrics, and therefore a supremely effective piece of performance art, but it also makes 'Rid of Me' a difficult record to meet halfway. But anyone willing to accept its sonic extremities will find 'Rid of Me' to be a record of unusual power and purpose, one with few peers in its unsettling emotional honesty.&quot;\n\nRipped with EAC v0.99 pre-beta in lossless FLAC format.\n\nTracks:\n\n1.
