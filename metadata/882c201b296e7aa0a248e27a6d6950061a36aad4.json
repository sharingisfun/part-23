The film stars \nAnne Hathaway\n as Mia Thermopolis, a teenager who discovers that she is the heir to the throne of the fictional \nGenovia\n, ruled by her grandmother, Queen Clarisse Renaldi, who is portrayed by \nJulie Andrews\n. It also stars \nHeather Matarazzo\n as Mia's best friend Lilly Moscovitz, \nHÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©ctor Elizondo\n as Renaldi's head of security, and \nRobert Schwartzman\n as Lilly's brother, who has a crush on Mia.\n\nIt was released to \nNorth American\n theatres on \nAugust 3 , \n2001\n and peaked at number three in the \nbox office. \nThe Princess Diaries produced ticket sales well over its production budget.\n \nPlot\n\nMia Thermopolis\n (Anne Hathaway\n) is a fifteen-year-old \ntenth grade\n private school student who lives with her mother Helen Thermopolis (\nCaroline Goodall\n) and fat cat Louie in a \nSan Francisco\n firehouse. Her father, Philippe Renaldi (who was divorced but in touch with her) died two months earlier in a car crash. Although Mia is an average student,\nshe is very unpopular, but has two good friends: Lilly Moscovitz (\nHeather Matarazzo\n) and Lilly's older brother, Michael Moscovitz (\nRobert Schwartzman\n), who has a \ncrush\n on Mia. Mia is regularly teased by her peers for her gawkiness and frizzy hair, mostly by Lana Thomas (\nMandy Moore\n), a fellow tenth grader who is captain of the school \ncheerleading\n team, and her friends. Mia is jealous of Lana because she is in a relationship with Josh Bryant (\nErik von Detten\n), a \ntwelfth grader  &quot;Backstreet Boy\n clone&quot; (as her mother describes him) on whom she has had a crush since grade school.\n\nShortly before Mia's sixteenth birthday, she learns from her mother that her paternal grandmother is visiting from \nGenovia\n, a fictional country in Europe (which bears some similarity to the actual \nRepublic of Genoa\n, had it not become part of unified \nItaly\n). At first Mia does not want to see her, but agrees to after some persuasion. The next day, Mia meets her grandmother, Clarisse Renaldi (\nJulie Andrews\n), at the Genovian consulate for the first time, who explains that the reason she wanted to see her was because of a &quot;life-changing&quot; problem. She learns\nthat her father was the crown prince of Genovia and she is the next crown princess of Genovia and the only heir to the Genovian throne because of her father's\ndeath. She was shocked to learn that she is a princess and exclaims &quot;shut up!&quot; to her grandmother's disapproval. Mia quickly leaves the house and returns\nhome, after which she begins fighting with her mother for not telling her when she was younger.\n\nMia's mother and grandmother convince her to attend &quot;princess lessons&quot; in preparation for her introduction to the Genovian government. Under supervision\nfrom her new bodyguard, the head of Genovian security, Joeseph (\nHÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©ctor Elizondo\n), Mia begins to forget to help Lilly with her homework or watch Michael's band, Flypaper, perform at a nearby \nauto mechanic\n shop. To look more presentable to the Genovian government, Mia receives a makeover from Italian hairdresser Paolo (\nLarry Miller\n), after which Lilly confronts her for being so distant and questions her about if she wants to be like Lana. When Mia tells Lilly that she is a princess,\ntheir relationship becomes stronger than before.\n\nA couple of days later, San Francisco learns that Mia is the Genovian heir after Paolo tells the media so everybody will know that he is the one that made\nPrincess Mia look like a princess. Although unimpressed, Clarisse opts to ignore the situation and prepares for the State Dinner, which Mia attends, though\nmanaging to somewhat humiliate herself in the process. The day after the State Dinner, Mia agrees to appear on Lilly's \npublic access television\n program Shut Up and Listen and to watch Michael's band perform at a venue that Saturday night. However, Josh asks Mia to go with him to the Baker Beach\nBash, the school's annual beach party, and she excitedly agrees. She remembers to tell Michael that she will watch see his band the following Saturday\nnight, but forgets to tell Lilly of the change. The beach party goes well at first, but spirals out of control when the media learn of Mia's presence.\nJosh publicly embarrasses her by kissing her in front of photographers, and Lana helps them take pictures of her clad only in a towel. This causes a media\nfrenzy and displeases Clarisse. Clarisse then gets a wake up call from Joe, telling her that she has to remember that although Mia is a princess, and the\nheir to her throne, Mia is still her granddaughter. Mia is almost 16 so she is almost able to drive a car, (her &quot;baby&quot;, a \nFord Mustang\n.) She takes a test drive with her grandmother and takes her to the arcade, and buys her a corndog. When they are driving back, Mia's grandmother tries\nto teach Mia of knowing what to use when driving a car. All goes well until Mia catches a very steep hill which causes her to crash into a bus load. The\npolice comes and Mia gets in trouble, until her grandmother reconsiders the policemen on a Genovian speech honoring them. Mia wowed is proud of her grandmother.\n\nTo reconstruct her friendships with Lilly and Michael, Mia invites them to the Genovian Independence Day Ball, where she must reveal whether or not she\nwants to accept her duties as a princess. Originally intent on running away to \nColorado\n because she wants to avoid renouncing her throne with a speech (Mia is terrible at public speaking), Mia finds a sixteenth birthday gift and letter from\nher father, written before his death. After reading the letter, she changes her mind and makes her way to the ball, as it begins raining. Her car's roof\nwill not go up though, so she is stuck driving in the rain and her car breaks down when she attempts to go up an incredibly steep hill. Joe finds her drenched\nhalfway to the event. Upon arrival, Mia makes a speech announcing her acceptance to the Genovian throne. She is happy to see that her friends attended,\nand kisses Michael in the garden. Clarisse and Joe also walk out of the Genovian consulate holding hands, showing sparks of a relationship. The film ends\nwith the cast dancing informally, and Mia on an airplane arriving in Genovia as she narrates the coming summer's events. \n\nProduction\n\nThe film was directed by \nGarry Marshall\n and produced by \nDebra Martin Chase\n and \nWhitney Houston . \nAnne Hathaway\n was hired for the role of Mia because Gary Marshall's granddaughters saw her audition tape and said she had the best &quot;princess hair.&quot;\n[2]\n\nHÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©ctor Elizondo\n, who appears in all the films which Garry Marshall directs,\n[3]\n plays Joseph &quot;Joe&quot;, the head of Genovian security. Garry Marshall's daughter, Kathleen Marshall, plays Clarisse's secretary Charlotte Kutaway. Charlotte's\nsurname is mentioned only in the credits, and Garry Marshall says it is a reference to how she is often used in \ncutaway\n shots. In one scene, \nRobert Schwartzman\n's real-life group \nRooney\n makes a cameo playing a garage band named Flypaper, whose lead singer is Michael, played by Schwartzman.\n\nThe book was set in \nNew York City\n, but the film's location was changed to San Francisco because Marshall's granddaughters lived there. West coast radio personalities \nMark &amp; Brian\n appear as themselves.\n\nThe Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement\n, the film's sequel, was released in August 2004. \n\nBox-office\n\nThe film opened to $22,862,269 from 2,537 theaters in the U.S. and ended its run with \n$\n165,335,153 worldwide. Reviews were mostly mixed as \nrottentomatoes\n came up with a 49% rotten rating with 52 out of 106 critics recommending the movie. \n\nCast\nlist of 13 items\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢  Anne Hathaway\n as \nMia Thermopolis\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢  Julie Andrews\n as Queen Clarisse Renaldi\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢  HÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©ctor Elizondo\n as Joe\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢  Heather Matarazzo\n as Lilly Moscovitz\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢  Mandy Moore\n as Lana Thomas\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢  Caroline Goodall\n as Helen Thermopolis\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢  Robert Schwartzman\n as Michael Moscovitz\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢  Erik von Detten\n as Josh Bryant\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢  Patrick Flueger\n as Jeremiah Hart\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢  Sean O'Bryan\n as Patrick O'Connell\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢  Sandra Oh\n as Vice-Principal Gupta\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢  Kathleen Marshall\n as Charlotte Cutaway\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢  Willie Brown\n as himself\nlist end\n\nSoundtrack\nMain article: \nThe Princess Diaries/The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement (soundtrack) \n\n[\nedit ]\nDifferences between the film and novel\n\nThere are many major differences between the film and novel.\n[4]\n While they essentially follow the same plot, there were additional sequences written for the film to produce more drama.\n[2]\n Mia is portrayed as a very awkward adolescent, and while in the film she is more comfortable with herself after the makeover, in the book she becomes more\nuneasy.\n[4]\n Other major differences include the following:\n\nlist of 34 items\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢  In the novel, Mia's grandmother is named Clarisse Renaldo not Renaldi\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢  In the novel, Mia's grandmother, Clarisse Renaldi, is not the Queen of Genovia, but instead the dowager princess. She is less considerate of Mia's feelings\nand is somewhat clueless about the lives of non-royal people. She frequently dresses in purple to emphasize her social status and speaks French most of\nthe time. Clarisse in the film has more heartfelt moments.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢  In the novel, Mia's father, Philippe Renaldi, is not dead. Instead, he is a survivor of testicular cancer and is physically incapable of producing another\nheir. Because Mia is his only daughter, this forces her to take the Genovian throne.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢  In the novel, Mia had previously met both her grandmother and her father. In the film, she says that she has never met either of them.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢  In the film, it is said that Mia's grandfather has been dead for a year.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢  While the film introduced Joe, the novel excludes his character. Mia has a bodyguard named Lars, who bears some distinction and similarity to Joe. Clarisse\nand Lars do not hint a romantic relationship like Clarisse and Joe do in the film. In \nThe Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement\n, a bodyguard trainee of Joe's named Lionel appeared in the film.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢  In the novel, Mia lives in New York, not San Francisco like in the film.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢  In the novel, Clarisse Renaldi lives in a grand suite of the La Plaza Hotel while visiting New York. In the film, she lives in a large \nconsulate\n-style house while visiting San Francisco. In the novel, &quot;Grandmere&quot; (Clarisse Renaldi) owns a poodle named Rommel while in the sequel to the movie, Clarisse\nhas a standard poodle name Maurice.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢  In the novel, Lana does not have friends named Ana and Fontana, and Lilly does not have a friend named Jeremiah. Mia has many other friends than Lilly\nand Michael, including Boris Pelkowski, Ling Su Wong, Shameeka Taylor, J.P. Abernathy, and Tina Hakim Baba (whom she befriends during a fight with Lilly).\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢  Other small changes include Lilly's cable show, which is titled Lilly Tells It like It Is in the novel and Shut Up and Listen in the film. Mia's teacher\nwho dates her mother Helen is not Mr. O'Connell and instead Mr. Gianini, who has a much larger role in the novel.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢  Josh and Lana's surnames are different in the film. Originally they were Richter and Weinberger respectively, and not Bryant and Thomas. Although it\nwas never disclosed why Josh's surname was changed, Garry Marshall said that &quot;Thermopolis&quot; and &quot;Thomas&quot; are close together alphabetically, which indicates\nthat Mia and Lana would sit near each other in their classes.\n[2]\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢  In the novel, Mia Thermopolis lives in an apartment; in the film, she lives in a house. Her neighbor in the novel is Ronnie, not Mr. Robatussen.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢  In the novel, Mia ruins Lana's outfit with ice-cream in defence of Tina Hakim Baba (who is not mentioned in the film), not Jeramiah (who is not even\nin the book). Within the novel she is given detention by the principal while in the film, the principal pretends not to notice.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢  Mia does not tell Lilly that she is a princess in the novel. And in the novel, Mia gets into a huge fight with Lilly when Lilly finds out that she is\na princess; in the film, their bond gets stronger.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢  Mia does not have a car in the novel.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢  In the novel, Mia's paternal grandmother Clarisse Renaldi does not go out for fun with Mia.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢  In the novel, Mia goes to Albert Einstein High School. The name in the film is changed to Garden Grove High School.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢  In the novel, Josh makes out with Mia on the doorstep to Albert Einstein High School since they were on their way to a school dance. In the film, they\nwere attending a beach party instead of a dance, and Josh kissed Mia outside the supplies cabin.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢  In the novel, Michael Moscovitz did not work at a car repair shop, Instead he donates his time to making an online magazine 'Crackhead'. He was musically\ngifted, however.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢  Fat Louie is ginger in the book, not black and white as in the film.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢  According to the novel, Mia does not move to Genovia in the end.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢  In the novel, Mia calls her paternal grandmother 'Grandmere' and not Grandma.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢  In the novel, Mia's maternal Grandmother is not dead. In fact Mia (in the novel) has seen her maternal grandmother and mathernal grandfather (Mamaw and\nPapaw) a couple of times.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢  In the novel, it is Grandmere who publicized Mia's royal heritage, not Paolo.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢  There is no Genovian Independence Day Ball in the novel.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢  In the film, Mia was turning 16 and had a learner's permit in driving. In the series, Mia did not turn 16 until book seven and a half: Sweet Sixteen\nPrincess. She was 14 in books one, two, three, and four. She turned 15 in book five, and was 15 until book seven and a half. In the series, she is currently\n16 and in her junior year of high school.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢  In the novel, Lilly and Michael are not twins like they are in the movie. Instead, Michael is about three years older.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢  In the novel, Mia has a crush on Michael, and it isn't explained, until the two finally get together, that Michael returned those feelings. In the film,\nMichael has an obvious crush on Mia, who appears not to feel the same way.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢  In the novel, Mia's full name is HRH Princess Amelia Mignonette Thermopolis Grimaldi Renaldo. In the film, Grimaldi and Renaldo are combined into one\nname: Renaldi.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢  In the film, Mia is portrayed as being a brunette and her hair is long and obviously curly, later \nstraightened\n. In the novel, Mia originally has dishwater-blonde hair which is dyed &quot;the same color as Lana Weinberger's&quot;, although later in the other books, Mia refers\nto her hair as dishwater-blonde again. also, in the book, it is short and 'not straight or curly' but goes triangular when grown longer.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢  In the film, Mia's most hated subjects are Gym and Debate. While, in the novel, it is true that in the novel Mia hates Gym, Algebra is her vice (no mention\nof Debate was given). It is also noted that Mr. Gianini (novel) teaches Algebra, while Mr. O'Connell (film) teaches Debate and History. There is also no\nmention of Choir in the novel, but there is also English, French, and Gifted and Talented.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢  The plot for the sequel film, \nThe Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement\n is not included in any part of the book series; that is, Mia does not become queen or has to get engaged in any of the books.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢  In the movie, Michael's band is named Flypaper and consists of people not important to the movie but in the novel, Michael's band is named Skinner Box\nand consists of more important people, such as Boris Pelkowski.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢  In film, Michael and Mia just decide to stay good friends while he goes off to tour the world with his band. In the novel, Michael goes to Columbia University\nand is still in a relationship with Mia. Michael and Mia break-up (in the novel) after Mia discovers he slept with Judith Gershner (not mentioned in the\nfilm) who also took his virginity. Mia, convinced that Michael lied to her, breaks things off with him.\nlist end\n\nAwards and nominations\n\ntable with 4 columns and 12 rows\nYear \nAward \nFor \nNotes  \n2001 \nHeartland Award of Excellence    \n2002 \nALMA Award\n - Outstanding Song in a Motion Picture Soundtrack \n&quot;Miracles Happen&quot; by \nMyra \nNominated   \nASCAP\n Top Box Office Film \nJohn Debney    \nArtios\n Award - Best Casting for Feature Film, Comedy \nMarcia Ross\nDonna Morong\nGail Goldberg \nNominated   \nBFCA\n Award - \nBest Family Film\n - Live Action     \nGolden Trailer\n Award - Best Animation/Family     \nHollywood Makeup Artist and Hair Stylist Guild\n Award - Best Contemporary Makeup - Feature \nHallie D'Amore\nLeonard Engelman    \nMTV Movie Award\n - Breakthrough Female Performance \nAnne Hathaway    \nTeen Choice Award\n - Film - Choice Actress, Comedy \nAnne Hathaway    \nTeen Choice Award - Film - Choice Movie, Comedy     \nYoung Artist Award\n - Best Family Feature Film - Comedy   \n\n \nThe Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement\n\nsubtitles english and spannish or french\naudio english or french\nscreen sise standerd 4:3\n\nThe Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement   \nMovie_the_princess_diaries_2  \nDirected by \nGarry Marshall  \nProduced by \nWhitney Houston\nDebra Martin Chase  \nWritten by \nMeg Cabot\n (characters)\nShonda Rhimes  \nStarring \nAnne Hathaway\nJulie Andrews\nJohn Rhys-Davies\nChris Pine\nHeather Matarazzo\nRaven-SymonÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©  \nDistributed by \nBuena Vista Pictures  \nRelease date(s) \nAugust 11, \n2004\n (USA)  \nRunning time \n113 min.  \nLanguage \nEnglish  \nBudget \nUS$40,000,000  \nPreceded by \nThe Princess Diaries  \nIMDb \ntable end\n\nThe Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement is the \n2004\n sequel to \n2001\n's \nThe Princess Diaries .\nAnne Hathaway, \nJulie Andrews , \nHÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©ctor Elizondo\n, and \nHeather Matarazzo\n return to portray their characters from the first Princess Diaries film, Princess Mia Thermopolis, Queen Clarisse Renaldi, Joe (Mia's bodyguard) and Lilly\nMoscovitz, respectively. \nGarry Marshall\n returned to direct and \nDebra Martin Chase\n to produce the sequel.\n\nNew characters include Viscount Mabrey (\nJohn Rhys-Davies\n), Lord Nicholas Devereaux (\nChris Pine\n, in his film debut) and Andrew Jacoby (\nCallum Blue).\n\n\n \nPlot\n\nThe film opens with Mia Thermopolis (\nAnne Hathaway\n) graduating from Princeton's Woodrow Wilson School. We learn that she and Michael have broken up since he went on tour with his band. Mia, Joe (\nHÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©ctor Elizondo\n) and Fat Louie fly to Genovia for Mia's 21st birthday and for her to take her grandmother, Clarisse Renaldi's (\nJulie Andrews\n) place as Queen of Genovia. At her birthday ball, she has to dance with all the eligible bachelors, who unfortunately are all horrible dancers or unattractive.\nShe meets with her royal friend, Princess Asana (\nRaven-SymonÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©\n), and while talking to her, she accidentally steps on a mysterious and handsome young man's shoe. She apologizes and he says it was his fault. Later, she\ndances with him. They are both obviously attracted to each other. While she's walking, a servant bumps into her with a tray and her tiara falls off, but\nViscount Mabrey (\nJohn Rhys-Davies\n) catches it and kindly places it back on her head. When she walks away, he reveals that he is planning to steal it (the royal position, not the actual\ntiara.)\n\nWhile exploring the palace, Mia stumbles upon a secret tunnel leading her to a window where she can overhear the meeting with Parliament and Clarisse. Viscount\nMabrey brings up that there is another heir to the crown, his nephew Lord Devereaux, and that Princess Mia cannot be Queen unless she gets married. Parliament\ngives her 30 days to find a husband. At first Mia does not agree to it, wanting to fulfill her dream of marrying out of love, but after remembering the\ninspiring words of her father, she agrees to an arranged marriage, like Clarisse did.\n\nClarisse invites Lord Devereaux to stay at the palace to keep an eye on him. Mia is shocked when she sees him, as he is none other than Nicholas (\nChris Pine\n), the man she danced and flirted with at the ball. She angrily stomps on his foot and storms off.\n\nTo cheer Mia up, Clarisse shows her the finished suite, with a huge closet equipped with clothes, shades and jewels. And out pops best friend Lily Moscovitz\n(\nHeather Matarazzo\n). Later, they view a slideshow of possible husbands, and Mia chooses Andrew Jacoby (\nCallum Blue\n), Duke of Kenilworth. They get to know each other, and Andrew proposes to her after a few days.\n\nMabrey and Nicholas are upset when they find out that Mia found a husband in less than a week. Viscount knows that Mia isn't happy with it, and has Nicholas\nto romance her so she'll change her mind about Andrew. Nicholas flirts with Mia in the palace, and they argue in a closet so nobody overhears them. A servant\nwalks in on them. Mia is mad but Nicholas is glad that the plan is working.\n\nMeanwhile, Joe asks Clarisse to marry him, since she won't be Queen and he won't be head of security after Mia's coronation. She says she'll think about\nit.\n\nMia starts her training. She has to through a flaming arrow through the Corination ring the night before she is crowned Queen, but she is horrible at archery.\nShe has to review the royal guards while riding side-saddle, which she can't do, so Clarisse makes her wear a wooden leg. Viscount bribes the horseman\nto spook the horse using a rubber snake. Mia's wooden leg falls off the horse and Mia is humiliated. Later in the barn, Nicholas supposedly tries to make\nMia feel better, but Joe walks in. Mia leaves and Joe tells Nicholas he wants to talk to Mabrey alone. Joe tells him that if he hurts Mia, he'll have to\ndeal with him.\n\nAt the garden party, Mia gets somewhat jealous seeing Nicholas with Lady Elissa. She purposely takes Andrew towards them and she and Nicholas brag about\ntheir dates. Elissa and Andrew, both feeling awkward, leave to get a drink. Nicholas tricks Mia into saying she's not attracted to Andrew, and they argue\nnear the isolated fountain, when Nicholas suddenly kisses Mia. At first, she goes along with it, then she remembers she's engaged. He keeps trying to come\non to her. She realizes that he's trying to get her to fall for him and starts pushing him away. They fall into the fountain. Clarisse is upset when she\nsees Mia soaking wet.\n\nDuring the Genovian Independence Day Parade, Mia sees a little girl (\nAbigail Breslin\n) being picked on by two boys. She stops the parade and talks to the girl, who's name is Carolina. She and most of the other children are orphans. She decides\nto let them join her in the parade. While the Viscount is angry, Nicholas is impressed.\n\nWeeks before the wedding, Mia has a bridal shower slumber party, inviting Princesses from all over the world. They set up a ramp in the ballroom, and they\nslide down them using mattresses. Later on, Clarisse and Asana sing the song Clarisse sang for Mia on her 18th birthday(Your Crowning Glory), but with\na little funk added to it.\n\nNicholas tells the Viscount that he thinks Mia should be Queen, so that way Genovia will be in good hands and Mia will be happy. Mabrey realises that Nicholas\nhas fallen in love with her and tells him that she's not going to leave Andrew for him. Nicholas says he just wants to stop trying to ruin her, and Mabrey\nagrees. When Nicholas leaves to tell Mia, Mabrey calls up local celebrity gossiper Elsie Kentworthy. Gretchen, the suspicious maid, overhears.\n\nMia is practicing archery when Nicholas comes over to help her out. He fixes her posture and tells her to relax. She gets a bullseye. He tells her that\nhe is leaving. Mia is upset, but says good-bye. He says he wants to meet her one last time. She obviously wants to meet him too, but she can't because\nthere's always someone watching her. He says he'll find a way.\n\nLater, Clarisse is dancing with herself to classical music and Joe joins her. He asks if she's been thinking about his proposal and she sadly answers yes.\nHer silence and facial expressions are enough. He accepts it and walks away.\n\nLater in the night, Lily says Nicholas is throwing stones at the window. Addressing her as &quot;Rapunzel&quot; he tells her to climb down the vine. They go to the\nlake and tell each other small secrets that most people don't know about them. Nicholas says that he wants to dance with her again, since the last time\nthey danced was on her birthday. They dance romantically and fall asleep there. When they wake up, they see a man in a boat videotaping them. Mia thinks\nNicholas planned it and storms off. When she gets back home, it has already been broadcast on TV. She apologizes to Andrew. Andrew is disappointed, but\nboth admit that they felt nothing from their relationship. Andrew says he still wants to marry her because he believes she'll make a good Queen.\n\nMia's mom and stepdad come for the wedding with Mia's new baby brother, Trevor. Paolo (\nLarry Miller\n) comes to give her a wedding look. Nicholas is debating on whether he should go to the wedding. Mabrey tries to hide his happiness. Gretchen finally speaks\nup and tells him that his uncle set up what happened at the lake. All forms of transportation are taken, so he takes his grandfather's bike until he borrows\na horse from a sheep herder. Mia is walking down the aisle, but stops and runs out. Clarisse goes after her and tells her not to make the same mistake\nshe did and give up finding love (she's obviously talking about Joe). Mia walks back inside and tells Andrew he can't marry him and that both of them deserve\na chance at true love. Andrew thanks her. Mia makes a speech that is broadcast in Genovia and the US.

The second movie was completely alternate from Meg Cabot's novels. Notable changes include:\n\nlist of 7 items\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢  Genovia is actually an absolute monarchy and a principality. There are no kings or queens, only princes and princesses.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢  Mia's right to the throne is not, and will never be, dependent on marriage.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢  In the books, Grandmere is actually a very selfish, vindictive person and tends to cause more problems for Mia than anyone else in her life.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢  Mia's father, Phillipe, is alive and well.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢  Michael Moscovitz did not &quot;get famous&quot; with his band, they actually disbanded after their high school graduation. Michael went on to Columbia University\nand invented an open-heart surgery robot prototype. Michael and Mia were, until the eighth book, still together.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢  Mia's personal bodyguard is not Joe. Joe does not exist in the books.

Reynolds-Abernathy IV, Tina Hakim Baba (Mia's &quot;second best-friend&quot;), Shameeka Taylor,\nLing-Su Wong, Kenny Showalter (Mia's first boyfriend), Rocky (her baby brother, although in the movie, Mia's mom and her stepdad do have a baby whose name\nis Trevor), and more.\nlist end\n\n \n[\nedit ]\nTrivia\nlist of 15 items\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢  Anne Hathaway's mother and director Garry Marshall have brief appearances in the film. Hathaway's mother was the leader of the chorus singing at Mia's\nwedding while Marshall was the middle drummer (the one on the left) in the coronation scene.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢  The jewelry worn by Anne Hathaway and Julie Andrews was all real Chopard. A guard was on set at all times. Julie Andrews says on the DVD commentary that\non many days she was wearing about a million dollars worth of jewelry.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢  When Queen Clarisse reacts to Princess Mia's claim to the crown being contested, the line she says (&quot;Shut UP!&quot;) is exactly the same as the one Mia says\nwhen Mia finds out she's a princess.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢  Julie Andrews\n's granddaughter, \nHannah Schneider\n is in this movie, her character being called 'Dancing Princess Hannah.'\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢  Joseph says to Viscount Mabrey that he has &quot;diplomatic immunities in 46 countries, including Puerto Rico.&quot; The joke is that actor \nHÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©ctor Elizondo\n (Joseph) is a Puerto Rican.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢  The Genovian motto, &quot;Totus corpus laborat,&quot; is improper Latin. Since &quot;corpus&quot; is neuter, the motto, which means &quot;the entire body works,&quot; should read:\n&quot;totum corpus laborat.&quot;\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢  Writer and creator of The Princess Diaries series, \nMeg Cabot\n, was initially enthusiastic about the second film \n[1]\n but later came to dislike the sequel and repeatedly mentioned all of the liberties the movie took, in the sixth Princess Diaries book Princess in Training.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢  Marvel comic book creator, \nStan Lee\n, makes an appearance in the movie as the &quot;Three Stooges Wedding Guest&quot;.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢  At the start of the film, when Mia is explaining how her mother surprised her by marrying her teacher, the footage that's seen is from a scene that was\ndeleted from the first film (the teacher got paint on his shirt sleeve, and in the scene that follows, he takes his shirt off just as Mia walks in after\nher makeover and catches him shirtless).\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢  After Clarisse's talk with Parliament, she speaks with Mia in the throne room. In the numerous hall of portraits of the Renaldi line, \nMartha Custis Washington\n's portrait is present.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢  Genovia was filmed partially at Universal Studios in California. It was also remarked by many film critics that Genovia looked remarkably like the Disney\nBacklot in Burbank, California.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢  Director Garry Marshall's youngest grandchild, Sam Marshall (child of Garry's son Scott) can be seen in the DVD bloopers and as the Ring Bearer in Mia's\nwedding, carried by his real-life father who plays &quot;Shades&quot; in the movie.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢  During Mia's slumber party, and when Clarisse sings a song for Mia, a guard is seen dancing outside the room where the party is taking place, but in\nthe next shot the same guard is in the back of the room standing perfectly still. (The guards are twins, according to the DVD's special features.)\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢  When \nJulie Andrews\n says to Mia, &quot;I've done quite a lot of flying in my time,&quot; she is referring to her part in \nMary Poppins .\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢  Anne Hathaway's commitment to starring in the movie meant that she could not play Christine in the 2004 movie adaptation of \nPhantom of the Opera\n pleas seed and enjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:882c201b296e7aa0a248e27a6d6950061a36aad4","amp;dn":"Princess+Diaries+1+and+2+DVD+full","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"882c201b296e7aa0a248e27a6d6950061a36aad4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,44,32,27,41,110,122,160,162,72,226,122,109,105,80,6,26,54,170,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
