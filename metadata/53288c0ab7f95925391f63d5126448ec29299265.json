Island set him up in a recording studio as vocalist for the one-off &quot;flower power&quot; pop band Argosy, which also included Reginald Dwight (later known as Elton John), Caleb Quaye, and Nigel Olsson.\n\nTheir sole single, &quot;Mr. Boyd&quot; b/w &quot;Imagine&quot;, consisted of two pieces of orchestrated pop (both penned by Hodgson) and was issued in 1969 on the DJM (U.K.) and Congress (U.S.) record labels. It sold poorly and remains rare and sought after. &quot;Mr. Boyd&quot; was covered in 1997 by Jake Shillingford and his band My Life Story on their album &quot;The Golden Mile&quot;.\n\n***** There are multiple copies of each song\nbecause the quality &amp; sound is different for each and it is your preference which ones to use in your playlist *****\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:53288c0ab7f95925391f63d5126448ec29299265","amp;dn":"Argosy+%28Roger+Hodgson+of+Supertramp%29+-+Imagine+%26amp%3B+Mr.+Boyd","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"53288c0ab7f95925391f63d5126448ec29299265","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,40,140,10,183,249,89,37,57,31,99,213,18,100,72,236,41,41,146,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
