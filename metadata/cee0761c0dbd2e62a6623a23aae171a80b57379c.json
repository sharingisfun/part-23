It formed in 2004 and signed to Prosthetic Records. Originally formed by Chris Letchford (Guitar), and Travis Levrier (Guitar), Pat Skeffington (Drums), and Jordan Eberhardt (Bass guitar), but after the release of their latest album, V, Chris Letchford is the only remaining founding member.\r\n\r\nDue to rhythmical complexity (&quot;off-time chugs&quot;), the use of extended range guitars, and the general &quot;vibe&quot;, their music is often ascribed to be djent despite much of their material being &quot;clean channel&quot; which contradicts the early onomatopoeic etymology of the genre's name.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlbums included:\r\n2007 - Monument\r\n2009 - Carving Desert Canyons\r\n2011 - The Collective\r\n2013 - The Migration\r\n2015 - V\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. All studios songs must be present at 320kbps.\r\n2. Demos are not required, but if included they will be included as duplicates.\r\n3. Live albums are not required, but will be included if not difficult to find.\r\n4. If acoustic or instrumental versions are rare, then it is not necessary to include them.\r\n5. If some songs were never released in an LP or EP, i.e. from a soundtrack, then a &quot;Rare and Misc&quot; folder will include the overflow. Number is based on date they were created. If some songs were only ever included in Singles, they may or may not get a Single album, based on judgement.\r\n6. The goal is to be able to open a folder from your music player and have all of the songs available without duplicates. Because of this I will not include an identical song twice, with priority given to older album &gt; newer album &gt; EP &gt; Single.\r\n7. Metadata for all songs are edited by hand gathering information from sources like Wikipedia or Discogs.\r\n8. All Discographies are to be updated once a year in case of new albums, with the latest year in the title of the torrent.\r\n9. NEVER mention the name Vogard7A in any metadata or comments. I share music, I don't need to stamp my name on other peoples' great work.\r\n10. Include a playlist with my favorite songs from each band! You can delete this if it gets in the way.\r\n\r\nIf there are any errors (not subjective opinions about organization) drop a comment and I'll look at it before updating the Discography next year!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cee0761c0dbd2e62a6623a23aae171a80b57379c","amp;dn":"Scale+the+Summit+Discography+%282016%29+%40320kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cee0761c0dbd2e62a6623a23aae171a80b57379c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,224,118,28,13,189,46,98,166,98,58,35,170,225,113,168,11,87,55,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
