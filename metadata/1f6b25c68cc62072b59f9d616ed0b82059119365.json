The first track\nis a 2-minute warm-up, to get the muscles working, do some stretching. The\nsecond, title track, is a monster truck getting up to speed, slowly at first,\nbut once it has reached its peak of intensity, it keeps it going, full blast,\nrelentlessly, for some eight minutes, after which the whole thing relaxes\nagain. But all that was just setting the scene for what is coming next, a\n31-minute track, called &quot;This Is Murder&quot;, and it is, in a way. It is absolutely\nagonising in its physical power, in its emotional power, in its musical power,\nin its lyrical power, and fabulous in the tension it creates, brilliant in the\nstark contrast between the violent and the tender moments. Magnificent. The last\npiece starts slowly, but becomes fierce near the end, and is by itself still\nfine, but kind of an anti-climax after its ferocious predecessor. Can you create\nworlds of sounds with just three acoustic instruments? Yes, you can. Does one\ntrack justify buying the album? It does!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f6b25c68cc62072b59f9d616ed0b82059119365","amp;dn":"Tony+Bevan%2C+Chris+Corsano%2C+Dominic+Lash+-+Monster+Club+%282008%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f6b25c68cc62072b59f9d616ed0b82059119365","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,107,37,198,140,198,32,114,181,159,157,97,110,208,184,32,89,17,147,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
