They even had the gimmick on tv back in the 80's as Harley Race, Jim \nDuggan, Haku, and Randy Savage all held the crown. This was the 80's and WWF had \nthe talent to spare plus they had good storylines that made sense. Anyways, King \nof The Ring was always one of my favorite WWF PPV's. Granted, 1995 King of the \nRing was one of the worst PPV's of all time. There is too many repeats on this \nset that could have been avoided, but Mankind-Undertaker Hell in the Cell and \nAngle-McMahon Street Fight are two of the best matches you'll ever see so I \nunderstand putting that on another disc. However, King of The Ring 1994 had one \nof the greatest 3 minute matches you'll ever witness, Owen Hart VS 1-2-3 Kid. \nIf you've never watched it, go out and do so. The opening contest of that PPV, \nRamon vs Bigelow, was pretty damn good as well. The Diesel VS Bret Hart match on \nthe same PPV was pretty great as well. All in all, i'm a fan of the WWF I grew \nup on. The 90's may have not been the cool time to watch WWF but alot of those \nmatches and storylines beats out anything the WWE is putting out today. I wish \nthey focused more on earlier King of The Rings rather then random matches on the \nPPV. I think they should have just put out the entire King of The Ring PPV set \nrather then this decent but could have been so much better set.\n\nDisc 1\n\nThe Noble Scroll\n\nKing of the Ring Finals Match\nBret `Hit Man' Hart vs. Bam Bam Bigelow\nKing of the Ring 13th June, 1993\n\nKings and Champions\n\nWWE Championship Match\nHulk Hogan vs. Yokozuna\nKing of the Ring 13th June, 1993\n\nKing of the Ring Finals Match\nOwen Hart vs. Razor Ramon\nKing of the Ring 19th June, 1994\n\nA True King\n\nKiss My Foot Match\nBret `Hit Man' Hart vs. Jerry &quot;The King&quot; Lawler\nKing of the Ring 25th June, 1995\n\nIntercontinental Championship Match\nGoldust vs. Ahmed Johnson\nKing of the Ring 23rd June, 1996\n\nNew Breed of Royalty\n\nKing of the Ring Finals Match\nStone Cold Steve Austin vs. Jake &quot;The Snake&quot; Roberts\nKing of the Ring 23rd June, 1996\n\nDisc 2\n\nMark of Distinction\n\nWWE Championship Match\nShawn Michaels vs. British Bulldog Davey Boy Smith\nKing of the Ring 23rd June, 1996\n\nStone Cold Steve Austin vs. Shawn Michaels\nKing of the Ring 8th June, 1997\n\nBlue Blood\n\nKing of the Ring Finals Match\nTriple H vs. Mankind\nKing of the Ring 8th June, 1997\n\nKing of the Ring Finals Match\nKen Shamrock vs. The Rock\nKing of the Ring 28th June, 1998\n\nA Night in Hell\n\nHell in a Cell Match\nUndertaker vs. Mankind\nKing of the Ring 28th June, 1998\n\nDisc 3\n\nElectrifying Champion\n\nWWE Championship Match\nUndertaker vs. The Rock\nKing of the Ring 27th June, 1999\n\n6 Man Tag Match for the WWE Championship\nTriple H, Mr. McMahon &amp; Shane McMahon vs. The Rock, Undertaker &amp; Kane\nKing of the Ring 25th June, 2000\n\nKing of the Ring Finals Match\nRikishi vs. Kurt Angle\nKing of the Ring 25th June, 2000\n\nKing Kurt\n\nLight Heavyweight Championship Match\nJeff Hardy vs. X-Pac\nKing of the Ring 24th June, 2001\n\nKing of the Ring Finals Match\nEdge vs. Kurt Angle\nKing of the Ring 24th June, 2001\n\nStreet Fight\n\nStreet Fight\nShane McMahon vs. Kurt Angle\nKing of the Ring 24th June, 2001\n\nKing of the Ring Finals Match\nRob Van Dam vs. Brock Lesnar\nKing of the Ring 23rd June, 2002\n\nHulk Hogan vs. Kurt Angle\nKing of the Ring 23rd June, 2002\n\nKing of the Ring Finals Match\nBobby Lashley vs. Booker T\nJudgment Day 21st May, 2006\n\nAll Hail King Booker!\n\nKing of the Ring Finals Match\nCM Punk vs. William Regal\nMonday Night Raw 21st April, 2008\n\nKing of the Ring Finals Match\nJohn Morrison vs. Sheamus\nMonday Night Raw 29th November, 2010\n\nMajestic Memories\n\nScreenshots:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/58000/photo-57236.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/58000/photo-57236.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/58000/photo-57237.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/58000/photo-57237.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/58000/photo-57238.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.postimg.com/58000/photo-57238.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b2c1c83cbc866b72dd379ffba9cbb8313e8aebce","amp;dn":"WWE.The.Best.Of.King.Of.The.Ring.2011.DVDRip.x264-RUDOS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b2c1c83cbc866b72dd379ffba9cbb8313e8aebce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,193,200,60,188,134,107,114,221,55,159,251,169,203,184,49,62,138,235,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
