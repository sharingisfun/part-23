Woo Hoo\n2. Head To Toe\n3. My Third House\n4. California Waiting (Alternate Version)\n5. Dusty (Piano Version)\n6. Wicker Chair\n7. Talihina Sky (Alternate Version)\n8. Molly's Hangover\n9.

My Party (Kenna &amp; Chad Hugo Remix)\n\nINFO:\n\n\tI decided to make this compilation a few weeks ago out of anticipation of the new album. I acquired the bonus tracks from the &quot;B-Sides PLUS!!&quot; torrent that has been floating around for a while. I added a few more tracks which were either from other torrents or ripped from stream sites, and added some artwork so it looks good in your iTunes library. Quality varies, but all are decent/good quality rips. The &quot;Kings of Leon: B-Sides and Rarities&quot; compilations are something I am going to continue to make. Volume 2 has been started, but I will wait to upload it as soon as those iTunes exclusive tracks pop up somewhere.\n...............................................................................\n\n\n\n\nKings of Leon: B-Sides and Rarities Vol. 2\n\n1.

It will feature Frontier City and the Bucket CSS Mix as well as several other rare tracks.\n...............................................................................","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:09edd10d6bbf36172e0a6a7d3f2b351af3165919","amp;dn":"Kings+of+Leon+-+B-Sides+%26+Rarities+Volumes+1%262","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"09edd10d6bbf36172e0a6a7d3f2b351af3165919","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,237,209,13,107,191,54,23,46,10,106,125,63,43,53,26,243,22,89,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
