As it spread from the Deep South to Chicago and beyond, the blues incorporated a powerful musical groove which has influenced music around the world. Now, musicians are reaching across the Atlantic and finding that they have a common story to tell in shades of blue.\nPutumayoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s African Blues chronicles the return of the blues to its African motherland. It also demonstrates the burgeoning connections between West and East African musicians and performers from the bluesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ traditional heartland in the U.S., as well as converts in EuropeÃ¢â‚¬â€and shows how these connections are revolutionizing traditions on both continents. \n-- Putumayo.com\n\n...what makes Putumayo Presents African Blues particularly fascinating is that it's a type of frequently attempted fusion that often ends up drab. I would describe this set as delicate, airy, sure-footed and strong all the way through. --Milo Miles, npr.org\n__________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nEnjoy!\n\nIf you have any special requests for other Putumayo records, let me know and I'll see what I can do.\n\n\n\nIf you have any of the following Putumayo records, an upload would be greatly appreciated:\n\n- Music of the Andes\n- Australia\n- Australian Playground\n- Instrumental Dreamland\n- American Playground\n- Cowboy Playground\n- Latin Dreamland\n- World Singalong","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8549659660f32f1a8929b3790afd1410f2f5fca9","amp;dn":"Putumayo+Presents+-+African+Blues+%282012%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8549659660f32f1a8929b3790afd1410f2f5fca9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,73,101,150,96,243,47,26,137,41,179,121,10,253,20,16,242,245,252,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
