Here's a programme full of curiosities and strange delights. It's the sort of thing that keeps you cheerfully amazed and amused in the same way that a copy of The Guinness Book of World Records once kept nine-year-old boys amazed and amused all through Boxing Day. Ostensibly, it's about the work of the team who put that noble reference work together. Their working life involves assessing the world's largest cream-filled biscuit, say, or the longest arm-hair ever, or the most eggs crushed with the head in a minute - and taking it all seriously.\nBut it's also about the urge to attempt such feats. The ghost of Roy Castle will be smiling down on the scene where a Nepalese man jumps through an unstringed tennis racket 90 times in three minutes. It's a sight you don't forget in a hurry. Best of all, look out for the wonderful sequence where the team try to establish the cat that has the world's loudest purr.\n\n\n\n2)  Part 2 \nThe second and final part of a unique documentary which takes a look behind the scenes at Guinness World Records, This episode features another set of incredible record holders - from Zeus, a Great Dane from Michigan who is the world's tallest dog, to Ashrita Furman- holder of the title for most current Guinness World Records held at the same time by an individual. We also get to meet Wilma Conner, the oldest competitive female bodybuilder, Pauline Potter, the world's heaviest woman, and daredevil grandad Tom Lackey, the world's oldest wing walker.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img28.imageshack.us/img28/5873/insideguinnessworldreco.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img28.imageshack.us/img28/5873/insideguinnessworldreco.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img560.imageshack.us/img560/5873/insideguinnessworldreco.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img560.imageshack.us/img560/5873/insideguinnessworldreco.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img94.imageshack.us/img94/5873/insideguinnessworldreco.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img94.imageshack.us/img94/5873/insideguinnessworldreco.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img198.imageshack.us/img198/5873/insideguinnessworldreco.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img198.imageshack.us/img198/5873/insideguinnessworldreco.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img32.imageshack.us/img32/5873/insideguinnessworldreco.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img32.imageshack.us/img32/5873/insideguinnessworldreco.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img829.imageshack.us/img829/5873/insideguinnessworldreco.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img829.imageshack.us/img829/5873/insideguinnessworldreco.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img13.imageshack.us/img13/5873/insideguinnessworldreco.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img13.imageshack.us/img13/5873/insideguinnessworldreco.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img402.imageshack.us/img402/5873/insideguinnessworldreco.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img402.imageshack.us/img402/5873/insideguinnessworldreco.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img28.imageshack.us/img28/5373/insideguinnessworldrecoz.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img28.imageshack.us/img28/5373/insideguinnessworldrecoz.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 2004 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 416\n * Video Aspect Ratio: (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 25\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 46.Mins\n * Number Of Parts: 2\n * Part Size: 701 MB\n * Source: PDTV\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guinness_World_Records&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guinness_World_Records&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:86b3565d17c1f96cb44f24a647fa686c800091a9","amp;dn":"ITV+Inside+Guinness+World+Records+2of2+PDTV+XviD+AC3+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"86b3565d17c1f96cb44f24a647fa686c800091a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,179,86,93,23,193,249,108,180,79,36,166,71,250,104,108,128,0,145,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
