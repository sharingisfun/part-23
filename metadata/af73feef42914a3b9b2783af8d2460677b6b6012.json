The NPO was established by a secret executive order (National Security Decision Directive 55) signed on 14 September 1982 by President Ronald Reagan during the Cold War in preparation for a nuclear war, presumably with the Soviet Union. The NPO plan was classified Top Secret, codeword Pegasus. It was also referred to as Project 908 (also known as &quot;Nine Naught Eight&quot;). \n\nThe only oversight was by a Project Pegasus committee chaired by then-Vice President George Herbert Walker Bush. The committee included The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (or his deputy), FBI Director William H. Webster, Attorney General Edwin Meese III and other top cabinet officials. The action officer for the project was Marine Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North, who then worked at the National Security Council under retired Marine Lieutenant Colonel Robert McFarlane. \n\nPresident Bill Clinton attempted to dismantle the NPO during his tenure in the White House; he cancelled Project Pegasus and declassified it. However, those efforts proved incomplete when the legacy NPO plan for Continuity of Government was briefly activated by President George W. Bush on September 11, 2001 in response to the terrorist attacks on New York City and Washington, DC. \n\nThe relocatable communications vans that had already been built were put under the command of the U. S. Army's 11th Signal Brigade at Fort Huachuca, Arizona. Similarly equipped trucks are presently within the inventory of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), called Multi-Radio Vans.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af73feef42914a3b9b2783af8d2460677b6b6012","amp;dn":"Project+908","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af73feef42914a3b9b2783af8d2460677b6b6012","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,115,254,239,66,145,74,59,155,39,131,175,141,36,96,103,123,107,96,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
