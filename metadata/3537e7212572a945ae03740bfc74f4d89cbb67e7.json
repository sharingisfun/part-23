Still a fun game to play.\n\n\n\nGame Description:\n\nGabriel Logan, one of the government's top covert agents, must neutralize the terrorists that threaten Washington D.C. and destroy a biological weapon that has been built to end the lives of millions of innocent people. \n\nSyphon Filter is an action game played from the 3rd person.
