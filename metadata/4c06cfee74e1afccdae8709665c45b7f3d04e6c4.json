The oil industry is certainly facing challenging times. While the world is still thoroughly dependent on Ã¢â‚¬Ëœblack goldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, change is on the horizon. Capital expenditure by the largest oil companies is now five times what it was in 2000, yet production has barely increased. The implications of this looming Ã¢â‚¬Ëœcarbon bubbleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ are gradually dawning on the financial sector. Grassroots resistance to oil extraction is racking up successes, and fossil-fuel divestment campaigns are sweeping the globe. But the likes of Shell, Exxon and Chevron wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t go down without an almighty fight. The November issue of New Internationalist will explore these momentous developments and highlight strategies to prize big oilÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s toxic grip from our political process","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c06cfee74e1afccdae8709665c45b7f3d04e6c4","amp;dn":"New+Internationalist+-+November+2014","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c06cfee74e1afccdae8709665c45b7f3d04e6c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,6,207,238,116,225,175,204,218,232,112,150,101,196,91,127,61,4,230,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
