You'll have over 40 fighters to choose from, including Ryo Sakazaki, Chizuru Kagura, and Goro Daimon. Pit them against each other in a ton of cool 2D environments that will put your skills to the test. Show your stuff in Team Play, Team Versus, Single Play, Single Versus, Survivor, and Practice. With so many modes and characters to choose from, your thumbs better be in good shape, or you'll spend most of your time facedown in defeat. In addition to your standard light kick, heavy kick, light punch, and heavy punch, there are special moves that you must master in order to be successful and crown yourself the ultimate King of Fighters.\n\nRelease Date: October 22, 1999\nT for Teen: Animated Violence, Suggestive Themes\nGenre: Fighting\nPublisher: SNK\nDeveloper: SNK\n\n*40 playable characters; 2D environments; variety of gameplay modes; special moves for each character; hand-to-hand combat\n\nGame Details\nMedia: 1 x CD-R\nRegion: NTSC\nLanguages: English-Portuguese-Japanese-Spanish\nPlayers: Multiplayer\n\n\nFile Details\nFormat: CDI\nUnpacked size: 745 MB (781.905.948 bytes)\nTested and working with NullDC\n\nInstructions\n1.
