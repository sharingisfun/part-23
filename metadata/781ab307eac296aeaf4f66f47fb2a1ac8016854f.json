And why, despite every disappointment, we keep fighting to get it right.\n\nJennifer must do the impossible Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bring her mother home. When a family is torn apart by death, two sisters take violently divergent paths and the story of their family appears to end terribly and abruptly. Two decades later Jennifer never dreams that the photo she finds stuck between the pages of a neglected book will tear open a gaping wound to her motherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s secret past. Abandoning her comfortable life with her parents and best friend in the wheat fields of Nebraska, JenniferÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s quest for a hidden aunt leads her to the untamed coast of Maine where she struggles to understand why her mother lied to her for sixteen years.\n\nAcross the grey, rocky cove she meets Nathan Moore, the young, reluctant genius surrounded by women who need him to be brother, father, friend, provider, protector and now, first love. The stories, varied, hilarious, and heartbreaking, unfold to paint a striking mural of the shattered past. As Jennifer seeks to piece together her motherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s story, she inadvertently writes one for herself.\n\n\n\n                            Format 1 - .ePUB\n\n                            Format 2 - .Mobi\n\n\n         **Support Your Favorite Authors By Buying Their Books**\n\n             Check out all my Magazine and ebook uploads here.\n\n                &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:781ab307eac296aeaf4f66f47fb2a1ac8016854f","amp;dn":"On+Little+Wings+by+Regina+Sirois","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"781ab307eac296aeaf4f66f47fb2a1ac8016854f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,26,179,7,234,194,150,174,175,79,102,244,127,178,161,172,128,22,133,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
