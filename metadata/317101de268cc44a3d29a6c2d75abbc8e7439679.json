Ripped to 192k mp3, because tape quality does not justify a high bitrate torrent. \n\nFrom Stephen Stills:\n &quot;I was at a Judy Collins session in New York in 1968, and when she was finished, I peeled off a few hundreds for the engineer so I could make a tape of my new songs. Some you&amp;#039;ll know; some you might not. The following fall we made the first CSN album, and the tape has been lost to the wind for almost 40 years. Somehow, it&amp;#039;s found its way back, and these songs now feel like great friends when they were really young.&quot;\n--From the liner notes.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:317101de268cc44a3d29a6c2d75abbc8e7439679","amp;dn":"Stephen+Stills+-+Just+Roll+Tape-+April+26th%2C+1968+%40192k+%28oldiesg","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"317101de268cc44a3d29a6c2d75abbc8e7439679","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,113,1,222,38,140,196,74,61,41,166,194,215,90,187,200,231,67,150,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
