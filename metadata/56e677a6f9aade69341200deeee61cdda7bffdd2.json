The first person to live to 150 years has probably already been born.\n\nWhat will your life look like when you live to be over 100? Will you be healthy? Will your marriage need a sunset clause? How long will you have to work? Will you finish one career at sixty-five only to go back to school to learn a new one? And then, will you be happily working for another sixty years? Maybe youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be a parent to a newborn and a grandparent at the same time. Will the world become overpopulated? And how will living longer affect your finances, your family life, and your views on religion and the afterlife?\n\nIn 100 Plus, futurist Sonia Arrison takes us on an eye-opening journey to the future at our doorsteps, where science and technology are beginning to radically change life as we know it. She introduces us to the people transforming our lives: the brilliant scientists and genius inventors and the billionaires who fund their work. The astonishing advances to extend our livesÃ¢â‚¬â€and good healthÃ¢â‚¬â€are almost here. In the very near future fresh organs for transplants will be grown in laboratories, cloned stem cells will bring previously unstoppable diseases to their knees, and living past 100 will be the rule, not the exception.\n\nSonia Arrison brings over a decade of experience researching and writing about cutting-edge advances in science and technology to 100 Plus, painting a vivid picture of a future that only recently seemed like science fiction, but now is very real. 100 Plus is the first book to give readers a comprehensive understanding of how life-extending discoveries will change our social and economic worlds. This illuminating and indispensable text will help us navigate the thrilling journey of life beyond 100 years.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:56e677a6f9aade69341200deeee61cdda7bffdd2","amp;dn":"100+Plus%3A+How+the+Coming+Age+of+Longevity+Will+Change+Everything","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"56e677a6f9aade69341200deeee61cdda7bffdd2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,230,119,166,249,170,222,105,52,18,0,222,238,230,28,221,167,191,253,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
