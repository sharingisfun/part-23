The band carried the momentum into a red-hot &quot;Kind of Bird&quot; that tore the roof off the Beacon!  The Asbury Jukes horn section added a lot to the ominous tone of &quot;Blind Willie McTell,&quot; sung brilliantly by Gregg and Warren.\n\nThe Juke Horns stayed on for the next two songs, which also featured guitarist Rich Robinson of the Black Crowes and keyboardist Steve Molitz of Particle.  &quot;Soulshine&quot; was made even more uplifting by the big band sound, and Warren sang with much soul on a poweful &quot;The Weight.&quot;  The first set wrapped up with a scorching &quot;One Way Out.&quot;  Not bad for a half a show!\n\nAfter kicking off the second set with &quot;End of the Line&quot; and &quot;Gambler's Roll,&quot; both of which found Gregg in great voice, the band dove into a fierce and exploratory &quot;Black Hearted Woman.&quot;  After that, Warren singing the Otis Redding classic &quot;I've Been Loving You Too Long&quot; was a great change of pace.  A funky &quot;The Same Thing&quot; with a stage full of guests was a showstopper, then the ABB played a magnificent &quot;Jessica&quot; where they didn't need any guests at all to hit the note!\n\nAn extended jam on &quot;No One To Run With&quot; was the encore to this great show, with a little hint of &quot;Blue Sky&quot; in the jam.
