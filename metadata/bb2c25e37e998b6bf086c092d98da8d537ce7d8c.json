Issue #1 was released in July 2006.\n\nThe Elephantmen series is a spin-off from the series Hip Flask, set in the same universe and expanding on details of various minor characters from that series. Each issue features two stories. The first spotlights a different Elephantman and their lives. The second tells, in several parts, a longer story involving a side adventure of Heironymous &quot;Hip&quot; Flask questing for an African artifact.\n\nElephantmen: War Toys is a three-issue mini-series prequel.\n\nI believe you will find this series worth the time and effort to look at it.\n\nThanks to the scanners and to the original sources who wish to remain nameless.\n\nPlease seed. Please enjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb2c25e37e998b6bf086c092d98da8d537ce7d8c","amp;dn":"Elephantmen","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb2c25e37e998b6bf086c092d98da8d537ce7d8c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,44,37,227,126,153,139,107,240,134,192,146,217,141,168,213,55,206,125,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
