Ryan had traveled to Ã¢â‚¬Å“Jonestown,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the cultÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s compound in the South American country of Guyana, at the behest of his constituents, some of whom had family members in the cult. Following RyanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s murder, Jones ordered his followers to commit mass suicide; more than 900 bodies were later found, most having died by taking poison. The FBI, charged with investigating violence against public officials, opened a probe into the murder of Ryan (hence the case name RYMUR) and provided other support and investigative assistance in relation to the mass casualties.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:54d81fe21c28fd9e3e2bff8585c4114bfd01f445","amp;dn":"FBI+File+Jonestown","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"54d81fe21c28fd9e3e2bff8585c4114bfd01f445","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,216,31,226,28,40,253,158,62,43,255,133,133,196,17,75,253,1,244,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
