Well most of the charactors in the film are the real life criminals that where involved in this drama remake of some, not all events, in what took place in some of there lifes in liverpool, Not all this story is fiction as most of it was real and did happen.. and the people in the film playing the parts are in prison for some of the crimes from that time.... But &quot;her majesty's hotels&quot; (prison) cant hold ya 4eva.. so most are out and about again.. ;)\n \n\n'''''''..................................................................'''''''\n....'''YouWereOnceASeedThenYouGrew'NowYourHere'SoSeedTheBreedAndLetItGrow'''..........''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''......","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c4be945c6e707a4bba26b1045c90922a9b0d4472","amp;dn":"Shooters-2001-DVDRip-Immagical.mp4v","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c4be945c6e707a4bba26b1045c90922a9b0d4472","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,190,148,92,110,112,122,75,186,38,177,4,92,144,146,42,155,13,68,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
