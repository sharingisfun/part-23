Rock Till I'm Rollin'           3:36\n\nRelease Notes:\n\nSimon Franks and Tom Dinsdale's follow their eponymous debut album 'Ego War'\nwith the highly anticipated 'Generation'. Taking in everything from ska to UK\ngarage, this is house music with the easy laddish charm of Squeeze or Madness\ncombined with sub-bass beats that tell ask you to do more than just raise your\nhands.\n\nAs the intro suggests, the dynamic duo are 'taking a new direction' with this\nalbum as they kick things off with the raucous energy and streetwise swagger of\n'Shot You Down', taking Nancy Sinatra's original from the 'Kill Bill' soundtrack\nand using its fearsome atmosphere, to play host to one of their most unashamedly\ndancefloor friendly cuts to date. Laden with wobbly basslines and dropping down\nto the barest of vocals it has tension, it has outright abandon, and it is\nundoubtedly one of the finest-crafted bootlegs to have emerged in the past few\nyears.\n\n'Bring Light' samples the Whispers 'And The Beat Goes On' to provide a jump up\nclub classic, the title track is reminiscent of the old skool rave scene with\ngritty basslines while 'I Won't Let You Down' has a thumping hook that just\ndoesn&amp;AElig;t quit, a common trait of a classic Bullys anthem. 'Eq-ing' rips a leaf\nout of the Prodigy rule book while nabbing one of the Chemical Brothers synths\nas the beats and distorted vocals warp into a massive main set anthem. Rooty\nToot Manuva makes a guest appearance on the hip hop tinged 'Made Like That'\nwhile 'This Road' features the Madness of Suggs.\n\nThe Audio Bullys are most definitely taking about their 'Generation' as the\nalbum shows a young band that blends the amphetamine dynamism of The Who with\nthe wry social comment of The Kinks, but still wraps it up in the\nribcage-bending thump of UK club culture.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d2fe27f0c8dd1bf0ab03a120b86adb42d6e48326","amp;dn":"Audio_Bullys-Generation-%28Advance%29-2005-RNS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d2fe27f0c8dd1bf0ab03a120b86adb42d6e48326","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,254,39,240,200,221,27,240,171,3,161,32,184,106,219,66,214,228,131,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
