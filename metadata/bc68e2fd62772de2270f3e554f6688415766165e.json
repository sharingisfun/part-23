But after some ifs and buts, we got it\nall working. We can not promise that the text is great but we\nhave made an effort to follow the swesub rules. The film has\nquite fast dialogues and since we are pretty much beginners\nwe hope you understand if we missed something. Enjoy!\n\n\nPLOT: Set on an island off the coast of New England in the summer of 1965,\nMoonrise Kingdom tells the story of two twelve-year-olds who fall in\nlove, make a secret pact, and run away together into the wilderness.\nAs various authorities try to hunt them down, a violent storm is\nbrewing off-shore -- and the peaceful island community is turned\nupside down in more ways than anyone can handle. Bruce Willis plays\nthe local sheriff. Edward Norton is a Khaki Scout troop leader. Bill\nMurray and Frances McDormand portray the young girl's parents.\n\n\nBIG thanks to BkX for all the help!\n\n\n- We are currently looking for:\n\n* 100Mbit+ EU Sites For Private Use\n* Suppliers Of Unreleased DVD's  US/EU\nWith 5 Mbit/s Upstream Minimum\n\nTEAM-FiRMAN (at) HUSHCOM\n\nASCii BY: T-BONE\n\nENJOY!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc68e2fd62772de2270f3e554f6688415766165e","amp;dn":"Moonrise.Kingdom.2012.LiMiTED.CUSTOM.SWESUB.NTSC.DVDR-FiRMAN","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc68e2fd62772de2270f3e554f6688415766165e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,104,226,253,98,119,45,226,39,15,62,85,79,102,136,65,87,102,22,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
