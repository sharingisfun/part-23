Eric Dolphy was a true nugget with its own, distinctive style of playing the viola, flute and bass clarinet. Although his music fell into the category of the avant-garde, he did not refuse the chord improvisation as a whole (although his works have always been rather abstract). When most of the free jazz musicians performed very serious music, solos Dolphy always made Ã¢â‚¬â€¹Ã¢â‚¬â€¹the audience a lot of impressions. In his improvisations, he enjoyed a very wide intervals, a variety of non-musical speech sounds, just follow his logic. Viola has always been a favorite and his main instrument, but that Dolphy was the first flutist, playing in the genre of bebop, and under his vliyaneem bass clarinet was introduced to jazz music as a solo instrument. He was also one of the first to play solos on the French horn. At the end of the '40s, Eric Dolphy recorded with Roy Porter and his orchestra in Los Angeles, to serve in the army, but in later years he played in clubs until he joined to Ã‚Â«Chico Hamilton QuintetÃ‚Â» in 1958. In 1959, he settled in New York and soon became a member of &quot;The Charles Mingus QuartetÃ‚Â». In the early '60s, Eric Dolphy difficulties began with the work because of its excellence, not all received playing style. In 1960-61 he appears rarely, but his playing can be heard in the New York jazz cafe Ã‚Â«Five SpotÃ‚Â» together with trumpeter Booker Litllom, Ornette Coleman and in several European concerts. At the end of 1961 Dolphy joined the group Ã‚Â«John Coltrane QuintetÃ‚Â», whose conservative critics rated the game as &quot;antidzhaz&quot; because of the long and very free solos. During 1962 -1963 Dolphy's played in the orchestra United States, and almost gave up his group. In 1964, he recorded his classic song Ã‚Â«Out to Lunch for Blue NoteÃ‚Â» and went on tour in Europe with &quot;The Charles Mingus SextetÃ‚Â». axial, in Europe and giving a few gigs, Eric Dolphy at the age of thirty-six years died suddenly in Berlin from diabetic coma, June 29, 1964. Virtually all songs of Eric Dolphy published. In addition, Dolphy can be seen in the movie with John Coltrane and Charles Mingus, released by Shanachie Records.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea9c400439fcde8510e62f2059cc26ad7dbb6d1a","amp;dn":"Eric+Dolphy+The+Complete+Prestige+Recordings+%281960-1961%29+%5B9CD%5D+-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea9c400439fcde8510e62f2059cc26ad7dbb6d1a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,156,64,4,57,252,222,133,16,230,47,32,89,204,38,173,125,187,109,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
