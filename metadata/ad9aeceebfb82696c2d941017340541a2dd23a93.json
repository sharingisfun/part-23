The train which takes them away brings to the village a physically and mentally handicapped woman, barely able to speak. She makes herself bracelets of burrs and studies herself in a cracked and cloudy mirror. Befriended by very few, teased and tormented by many she seeks protection at a huge portrait of Stalin. The children taunt her as Stalin's girlfriend. Far from Moscow, minor state functionaries fear scandal from poor Paranya who crosses herself in front of the portrait. The all powerful state which provides every family a cabbage one day, a melon the next, which gives a citizen the job of guarding waste is threatened by a flaxen-haired, childlike woman whose only clothing is a burlap sack.\n\nA half wit woman draws public attention is a Hungarian village during Stalin's rule. \n\nExcellent farce. You have to watch this film to believe it. Its a perfect film. Its damn funny too. Bacso confuses audiences with the dialogs and makes us realize that its us who are actually half wit. Its just brilliant. I laughed on so many scenes like mad. The length of the film is perfect. 89 minutes. Bacso just makes his point and its over. All the jokes are political in nature. My favorite scene is when the painting of Stalin is put up for display and the conversation of the local authority with the his boss on the phone. It's just too much. Its done in a very unique taste. A character is defined only to show how superstitions travel in a closed society.\n\nAlmost every actor is good. Camera work and scene composition are fantastic. Screenplay is unbelievably original. How a scene starts and where it ends is just a treat to watch.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ad9aeceebfb82696c2d941017340541a2dd23a93","amp;dn":"%E6%96%AF%E5%A4%A7%E6%9E%97%E7%9A%84%E6%96%B0%E5%A8%98%2FSzt%26aacute%3Blin_menyasszonya%2FStalin%27s+Fiancee%281991%29P%26eacut","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ad9aeceebfb82696c2d941017340541a2dd23a93","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,154,236,238,191,184,38,150,194,217,65,1,115,64,84,26,45,210,58,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
