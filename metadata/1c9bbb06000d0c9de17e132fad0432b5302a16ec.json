In 2012, the Nobel committee confirmed Mo Yanâ€™s position as one of the greatest and most important writers of our time. In his much-anticipated new novel, Mo Yan chronicles the sweeping history of modern China through the lens of the nationâ€™s controversial one-child policy.\r\n\r\nFrog opens with a playwright nicknamed Tadpole who plans to write about his aunt. In her youth, Guguâ€”the beautiful daughter of a famous doctor and staunch Communistâ€”is revered for her skill as a midwife. But when her lover defects, Guguâ€™s own loyalty to the Party is questioned. She decides to prove her allegiance by strictly enforcing the one-child policy, keeping tabs on the number of children in the village, and performing abortions on women as many as eight months pregnant.\r\n\r\nIn sharply personal prose, Mo Yan depicts a world of desperate families, illegal surrogates, forced abortions, and the guilt of those who must enforce the policy. At once illuminating and devastating, it shines a light into the heart of communist China","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c9bbb06000d0c9de17e132fad0432b5302a16ec","amp;dn":"Mo+Yan+-+Frog","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c9bbb06000d0c9de17e132fad0432b5302a16ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,155,187,6,0,13,12,157,225,126,19,47,173,4,50,181,48,42,22,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
