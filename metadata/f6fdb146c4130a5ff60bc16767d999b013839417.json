Myers attended school by day and at night frequented the nightclubs of the South Side of Chicago, meeting and sitting in with Jimmy Rogers, Muddy Waters, Howling Wolf, Little Walter, Hound Dog Taylor, Robert Lockwood, Jr., and Elmore James. Myers played drums with Elmore James on a fairly steady basis from 1952 until James's death in 1963, and is credited on many of James's historic recordings for Chess Records. In 1956, Myers wrote and recorded what was to be his most famous single, &quot;Sleeping In The Ground&quot;, a song that has been covered by Eric Clapton, Robert Cray, and many other blues artists.\n\n\n1 Waiting On You Mama \n2 Sam's Boogie \n3 Trying Hard \n4 Sad &amp; Lonesome \n5 Moving To The Country \n6 Looking For My Baby \n7 Remembering Elmore \n8 Snuff &amp; More Snuff \n9 Sleeping In The Ground \n10  Heart Is Crying Out \n\n\nRecorded in Jackson, MS, 1978\n\nSam Myers: vocal/harmonica, Jesse &quot;Lightnin'&quot; Russell: slide guitar, Robert Robinson:bass   Clarence Lee:drums \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f6fdb146c4130a5ff60bc16767d999b013839417","amp;dn":"Sam+Myers+Mississippi+Delta+Blues%28blues%29%28mp3%40320%29%5Brogercc%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f6fdb146c4130a5ff60bc16767d999b013839417","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,253,177,70,196,19,10,95,246,11,193,103,103,217,153,176,19,131,148,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
