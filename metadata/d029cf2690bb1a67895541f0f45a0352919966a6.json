If you are still plotting drawings and adding numbered stamps and revisions by hand, then QA-CAD 10 is for you! Save your valuable time and resources with our QA stamping software that overlays drawings with auto-numbered stamps and markup notes and corrections (text, sketches, boxes, lines and arrows).\n\nWith just a press of a button the drawing, along with the revision stamps and markup notes/corrections, can be saved to a PDF and sent in an email. The source drawing remains untouched by the stamping and markup operations.\n\nQA-CAD 10 also includes all the features and functions of CAD Viewer 10, CAD Markup 10, SymbolCAD 10, and also includes the valuable add-on extension CAD Viewer Batch Command.\n\nQA-CAD 10 is the perfect tool for drawing revision management because it's easy to use and has many features for the professional user such as embedding field-based data and attributes into the stamps. This data can then be exported to a spreadsheet making it easy to manage your drawing revisions.\n\nQA-CAD 10 includes all the CAD Viewer, CAD Markup, and SymbolCAD functions, plus\n\n- Add numbered QA symbols to CAD, PDF and raster drawings.\n- Attach data to QA symbols.
