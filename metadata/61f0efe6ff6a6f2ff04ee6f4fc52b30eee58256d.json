The name of the comic refers to the Windows command Control-Alt-Delete. It premiered on October 23, 2002, and is currently updated every Monday, Wednesday and Friday. The comic's focus has gradually shifted away from single strip gags towards longer story arcs and greater continuity. Buckley makes a living from Ctrl+Alt+Del, placing him in a small group of web comic artists devoted to their comics full-time.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.cad-comic.com/cad/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.cad-comic.com/cad/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThe files are stored as CBR files- these can be viewed with CDisplay or ComicRack (on Windows)\n\nGet em here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.geocities.com/davidayton/CDisplay.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.geocities.com/davidayton/CDisplay.html&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://comicrack.cyolito.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://comicrack.cyolito.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFile List\n2002.cbr\n2003.cbr\n2004.cbr\n2005.cbr\n2006.cbr\n2007.cbr\n2008.cbr\n2009.cbr\nJan 2010.cbr\nCAD Dates-Names.txt  (contains the names of the comic panel and the corresponding date and file name.)\n\nIf You Extract it with winrar or whatever you use the files are named by date in the format \n\n20021023    2002-10-23\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.cad-comic.com/cad/20021023&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.cad-comic.com/cad/20021023&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAs with my other torrents, I will seed for at least two months weather or not someone downloads this.
