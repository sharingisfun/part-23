This is a tax book. How fun a read can it be? How can it possibly keep my attention? How will I ever get through enough of this tome to learn how to do my own tax planning, plus what I need to prepare my tax return accurately and on time? WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re pretty good mind readers, arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t we? But youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re right on only one account: This is a tax book. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be pleasantly surprised, though (amazed and astounded, really), to find that this book does hold your attention, and you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have to pore over it from start to finish to get out of it what you need to pay less tax. As for the fun part, well . . . we promise this will be more fun than a root canal!\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.pdfdummies.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.pdfdummies.com/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c8ead200d3409406dd90635433016ccb96225365","amp;dn":"78+Tax+Tips+for+Canadians+for+Dummies+%28ISBN+-+0470676582%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c8ead200d3409406dd90635433016ccb96225365","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,234,210,0,211,64,148,6,221,144,99,84,51,1,108,203,150,34,83,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
