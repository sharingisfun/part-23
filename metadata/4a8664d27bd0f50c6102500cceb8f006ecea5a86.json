This adaptation of workflow is the work of a team, with leadership, clear vision, dedication, commitment, external drivers, experience, and the tireless work of those before us in this industry, who have paved the way with both successes and failure.\n\nThroughout the book, the author shares hard lessons-learned and guides the reader through the early warning signs that will help avoid the pitfalls. As systems progress, and the regulatory environments change, there will be new challenges and opportunities that will confront those setting up automated physician workflows. However, this book highlights and discusses all of the principles involved such as vision, leadership, project management and change management, which will always need to be incorporated to ensure project success. As such this book will be an important reference for anyone involved in the setting up or use of such systems from the physicians and medical professionals themselves through the medical informaticist to health system executives and other decision makers.\n\n- A comprehensive, practical guide to Computerized Provider Order Entry\n- Provide a concise guide to help both new and experienced health informatics teams successfully plan and implement CPOE\n- Draws on the authorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s decade-long experiences of implementing CPOE at a variety of academic, pediatric and community hospitals across the United States\n\nTable of Contents\nChapter 1.
