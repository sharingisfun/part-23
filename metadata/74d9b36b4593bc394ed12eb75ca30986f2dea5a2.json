The album was officially released on 11 June 2002 and featured the Grammy-winning single &quot;Here to Stay&quot;, as well as &quot;Thoughtless&quot; and &quot;Alone I Break.&quot; The album marks their second to use alternative metal but whereas Issues shifted away from the hip hop influenced nu metal which was highly present in their early albums, this album does see its return on certain tracks such as &quot;Bottled Up Inside&quot;.\nNew techniques were used on this album as well: Untouchables featured elements like undistorted guitars and electronics on some songs, giving the album an overall mellow but spooky feel, with one critic calling it a &quot;purgatorial symphony.&quot; Songs of this variety include &quot;Hollow Life&quot; and &quot;Hating.&quot; This is the only Korn album that does not feature bagpipes. Untouchables debuted at #2 on the Billboard 200 with 434,000 copies. The album received positive reviews from respected music magazines.\n\n* * * * * I have split track 14 into 2 separate tracks and I have left the original as is.\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Here To Stay\n[02] Make Believe\n[03] Blame\n[04] Hollow Life\n[05] Bottled Up\n[06] Thoughtless\n[07] Hating\n[08] One More Time\n[09] Alone I Break\n[10] Embrace\n[11] Beat It Upright\n[12] Wake Up Hate\n[13] Wake Up Hate\n[14] No One's There \t---&gt; [Stay (T Ray's Mix) Hidden Bonus Track]\n\n[14] No One's There \t---&gt; [Split Track]\n[15] Stay \t\t---&gt; (T Ray's Mix) [Split Bonus Track]\n \n\nMusic Video \n\n[01] Here To Stay [64mb]\n\n\n\nTotal Mp3 Play Time\t---&gt; 01h:05m:00s [Excluding Split Tracks]\n\t\t\t---&gt; 01h:14m:24s [Including Split Tracks]\n\nTotal File Size\t\t---&gt; 246mb (Including Mp3s, Art Covers &amp; WorDoc)\n\nTotal Bit Size\t\t---&gt; 320kbps\n\nMusic File Type\t\t---&gt; I-Tunes v8.2.1.6 Mp3 Format\n\nMusic Video Format \t---&gt; Quicktime\n\nScanned Artwork\t\t---&gt; Yes @ 300dpi 200dpi\n\nOriginal CD Rip\t\t---&gt; Yes - only1joe\n\nOriginal Uploader\t\t---&gt; Yes - only1joe \n\nUpload Speed\t\t---&gt; 33-35KB/s\n\nMusic Genre\t\t---&gt; Metal Rock\n\nOriginally Released\t---&gt; 11 June 2002\n\nRecord Company\t\t---&gt; Sony Music\n\nArtist Website\t\t---&gt; http://modlife.com/korn \n\t\t\t---&gt; http://modlife.com/korn/twitter \n\t\t\t---&gt; http://www.bebo.com/korn \n\t\t\t---&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korn \n\t\t\t---&gt; http://www.azlyrics.com/k/korn.html \n\t\t\t---&gt; http://www.muzu.tv/korn \n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n* * * IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents  * * *\n* * * This Is A Multi-Tracker Torrent Check Your Torrent Client For A True Number Of Seeds * * *\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:74d9b36b4593bc394ed12eb75ca30986f2dea5a2","amp;dn":"%5B2002%5D+Untouchables+-+Korn+-+246mb+%40+320kbs+%5Bonly1joe%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"74d9b36b4593bc394ed12eb75ca30986f2dea5a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,217,179,107,69,147,188,57,78,209,46,183,92,163,9,134,242,222,165,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
