After a youthful apprenticeship among the artists and intellectuals of Christiana in his native Norway, and after exposure to decisive innovations in Paris, his first major exhibition in Berlin in 1892 firmly established him as an original and controversial artist. His work soon came to exercise a crucial influence on the development of Expressionism, a movement that in altered forms is showing renewed vigor in Europe today.Preoccupied throughout his long and prolific career with themes of death, love, and sex, Munch sought to give visual expression to the inner nature of man. He was unusually sensitive to emotional experiences, and his work speaks directly to our own innermost feelings.In an introductory essay and in commentaries that accompany the forty color plates in the book, Thomas M. Messer, Director of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation in New York, traces Munch's growth as an artist, placing him in the context of his times. He introduces the reader to the family scenes and familiar places that haunt Munch's art, and to the wider relationships - with writers, poets, and patrons - that nurtured Munch and sustained him in difficult times.Munch is justly considered to be a master of the graphic arts. Here, prints and drawings are reproduced side by side with paintings, underscoring the intensity with which Munch worked out his themes and ideas in different mediums. Through all these Munch projects the psychic realities of his time through forms and images of great power","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ada56f06d4451384e9c077c70157a8ec57ea4b57","amp;dn":"Munch+%28Great+Modern+Masters+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ada56f06d4451384e9c077c70157a8ec57ea4b57","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,165,111,6,212,69,19,132,233,192,119,199,1,87,168,236,87,234,75,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
