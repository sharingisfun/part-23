But how will she cope when pitted against some of the most beautiful girls in the land?\n\nThe film digs deep into JackieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s difficult past: from hearing first hand how she came to realise she was trapped in a boyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s body and its affect on her close-knit family, and how she made the social transition from a boy to a girl, aged just eight; to how the bullying at high school led her to the brink of suicide and how her life was changed by a trailblazing American doctor who stopped the onset of male puberty.Ã¯Â»Â¿","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc3a2cb4ab15488a0620b8c25fb18ee3c2736039","amp;dn":"BBC+-+Transsexual+Teen+Beauty+Queen+-+2012","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc3a2cb4ab15488a0620b8c25fb18ee3c2736039","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,58,44,180,171,21,72,138,6,32,184,194,95,177,142,227,194,115,96,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
