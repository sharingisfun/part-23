Oh go on then, just a small turkey sandwich and a few quality street with my cuppa then. Sit back and relax with some choice cold cuts as we say goodbye to 2011.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://comfortconspiracy.co.uk&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://comfortconspiracy.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;\n\n====== About the Comfort Conspiracy =============\n\n\nComfort Conspiracy is a fortnightly music podcast brought to you by Phil ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“JentulmanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“ , Darren ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Stretcher MonkeyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“ and Stephen ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“So-FiÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, based mainly around electronic, beat and bass driven styles it often features, but isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t limited to, Drum and Bass, Dubstep, Electronica, Hip-Hop and House.\n\nWe are all enthusiastic bedroom producers and DJÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s and decided that a podcast would be a great way to share the music we love with each other and the rest of the world, plus itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a lot of fun to sit with your mates listening to and talking about music; So why not record it at the same time?\n\nWhilst the episodes reflect our personal tastes and therefor lean towards more electronic productions with a bias on beats, breaks, and bass, we have the good fortune to have friends with excellent taste who between them listen to a vast array of genres, so weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll be throwing in some curve balls into the mix, and inviting guests in on occasion to come and shake up the genres.\n\nThe main mission though is that each episode weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll be bringing you excellently produced tunes that weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re playing loads personally in the week running up to recording and hopefully we might get a chance to introduce you to something that might have slipped by unnoticed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a592c2facef26ceae34316aa362811e8c26548c","amp;dn":"Comfort+Conspiracy+Podcast+Episode+23","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2a592c2facef26ceae34316aa362811e8c26548c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,89,44,47,172,239,38,206,174,52,49,106,163,98,129,30,140,38,84,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
