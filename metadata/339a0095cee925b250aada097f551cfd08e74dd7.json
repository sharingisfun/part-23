Thus, Adobe Photoshop CS6 is the 13th major release of Adobe Photoshop. The CS rebranding also resulted in Adobe offering numerous software packages containing multiple Adobe programs for a reduced price. Adobe Photoshop is released in two editions: Adobe Photoshop, and Adobe Photoshop Extended, with the Extended having extra 3D image creation, motion graphics editing, and advanced image analysis features. Adobe Photoshop Extended is included in all of Adobe's Creative Suite offerings except Design Standard, which includes the Adobe Photoshop edition.\n\nAlongside Photoshop and Photoshop Extended, Adobe also publishes Photoshop Elements and Photoshop Lightroom, collectively called &quot;The Adobe Photoshop Family&quot;. In 2008, Adobe released Adobe Photoshop Express, a free web-based image editing tool to edit photos directly on blogs and social networking sites; in 2011 a version was released for the Android operating system and the iOS operating system.\n\nAdobe distributes Photoshop in both Windows and Macintosh versions.\n\nOn 21 March 2012, Adobe released a beta version of Photoshop CS6. It adds new creative design tools and a redesigned interface with a focus on enhanced performance.New features have been added to the Content-Aware tool such as the Content-Aware Patch and Content-Aware Move.\n\nAdobe Photoshop CS6 also brings suite of tools for video editing. Color and exposure adjustments, as well as layers are among a few things that are featured in this new editor. Upon completion of editing, the user is presented with a handful of options of exporting into a few popular formats.\n\nCS6 brings the &quot;straighten&quot; tool to Photoshop, where a user simply draws a line anywhere on an image, and the canvas will reorient itself so that the line drawn becomes horizontal, and adjusts the media accordingly. This was created with the intention that users will draw a line parallel to a plane in the image, and reorient the image to that plane to easier achieve certain perspectives.\n\nCS6 also allows background saving, which means that while another document is compiling and archiving itself, it is possible to simultaneously edit an image. CS6 also features a customizable auto-save feature, preventing any work from being lost.\n\nAdobe has responded to feedback from graphic designers and has modified the User Interface accordingly. Now, it boasts a more unified, static look, and is easier to keep track of all the palettes and documents.\n\n\n*****SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS****\n\nWindows\n\n    1.IntelÃ‚Â® PentiumÃ‚Â® 4 or AMD AthlonÃ‚Â® 64 processor\n    2.MicrosoftÃ‚Â® WindowsÃ‚Â® XP with Service Pack 3 or Windows 7 with Service Pack 1.
