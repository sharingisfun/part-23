It's Only Love\n\nAfter more than a decade drumming for Liverpool psychedelists the Coral, in 2009 Ian Skelly was struck down by a fever that led to him experiencing dreams and hallucinations. It inspired this solo debut, in which he filters guitars, flutes, mellotrons and sharp pop/folk songwriting through a psychedelic haze. Recorded on a vintage tape machine in the Coral's rehearsal space, much of Cut from a Star sounds as if it could have been blasted straight from the late 60s. The title track features the sort of lysergic-soaked melody beloved of the Move or Arthur Lee's Love. Nickel and Dime suggests Skelly bought a rail ticket at Liverpool Lime Street station and got off at Woodstock, while Caterpillar, ostensibly a song about a small crawling insect, enjoys a butterfly-like metamorphosis into a gentle but kaleidoscopic beauty. Skelly's lyrics about dreams within dreams and paper skies mig\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6b6ba0f9adcfd0d1032b297b5f58823a4aeb3e2","amp;dn":"Ian+Skelly+-+Cut+From+A+Star+%5B2013%5D+Vinyl%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6b6ba0f9adcfd0d1032b297b5f58823a4aeb3e2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,182,186,15,154,220,253,13,16,50,178,151,181,245,136,35,164,174,179,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
