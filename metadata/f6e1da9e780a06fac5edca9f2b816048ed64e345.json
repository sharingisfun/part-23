After meeting with a long time favourite of theirs, Cloud9, they decided to move in a different direction. Together they agreed that the band should do more pop collaborations in order to achieve a more mainstream fanbase. Soon afterwards they quickly began working on the album. On 8 November 2009, the duo entered the UK Top 40 for the first time with the track &quot;End Credits&quot;. The track was released on 2 November 2009 and featuring British musician Plan B managed to reach a peak of number 9 on the UK Singles Chart.

The single featured vocals from Mali and debuted on the UK Singles Chart at number 11; marking the duo's second consecutive Top 40 hit. &quot;Hypest Hype&quot; featuring Tempa T was confirmed in October 2010 to be the third single from the album and was released as a free download from their website on 8 November 2010; meaning it did not qualify to chart. The fourth single from the album is the dubstep-flavoured Blind Faith, which features Nottingham-born soul singer/songwriter Liam Bailey was released on January 24, 2011. The album also contains a new single 'Heavy' with Dizzee Rascal.[3] The album debuted at number 2 in the UK and was certified Gold in the first week of sales by the BPI.\n\n- woollytorrent -\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f6e1da9e780a06fac5edca9f2b816048ed64e345","amp;dn":"Chase+and+Status+-+Studio+Discography+-+2011+-+woollytorrent+-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f6e1da9e780a06fac5edca9f2b816048ed64e345","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,225,218,158,120,10,6,250,197,237,202,159,43,129,96,72,237,100,227,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
