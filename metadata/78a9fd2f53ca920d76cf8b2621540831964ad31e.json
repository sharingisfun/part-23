But even though Dylan Jr. released two largely acoustic sets under his own name since, this continuation (letÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not label it a comeback) reunites the singer/songwriter with co-founder/keyboardist Rami Jaffee and long time bassist Greg Richling for another go-round of lyrically challenging, tightly produced and played roots rock and roll.\n\nThe younger Dylan has admitted that the solo troubadour thing was only a career side road and being the frontman of a touring band remains his first love. Judging from these impressive results, he has picked up where he left off five years ago with an album that fits seamlessly into the WallflowersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ existing five disc catalog. Despite the recent promotional blitz, a change of label from Interscope to Columbia and a not particularly indicative single that sounds like a pretty good Clash B-side, little has altered in the WallflowersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ basic sonic template. JaffeeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s contributions remain mostly buried in the mix, making this a Dylan project in all but its name, although the extended layoff has provided a refreshed energy in the crisp soul undertones to songs such as the jaunty Ã¢â‚¬Å“ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a Dream,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the funky, nearly danceable Ã¢â‚¬Å“Misfits and Lovers,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the frisky Motown vibe of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Have Mercy on Him NowÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and the anthemic, Springsteen inspired Ã¢â‚¬Å“Love is a Country.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ J. DylanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s grainy croon remains instantly recognizable. Whether there is anything here that will capture the radio waves like 1996Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s classic Bringing Down the Horse Ã¢â‚¬â€œ- home of the WallflowersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ three biggest hits that are still played on whatever rock stations are leftÃ¢â‚¬â€œremains to be seen. But DylanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s talent for matching, smart plentiful (arguably too much so) words to chiming melodies supported by a solid, unpretentious rock band and sung with conviction has returned.\n\nUnlike other backing outfits like the E Street Band or PettyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Heartbreakers, the largely faceless Wallflowers donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have an identifiable sound. Guitarist Stuart Mathis gets few chances to strut whatever stuff he might have in DylanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tightly constructed songs, only two of which break the four minute mark. Dylan remains the star of the show, spitting out sharp, somewhat obtuse lyrics that push rockers like the opening Ã¢â‚¬Å“Hospital for SinnersÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and the following Ã¢â‚¬Å“Misfits and Lovers,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the latter a zippy track with a singalong chorus and a rhythm that borrows from Ã¢â‚¬Å“This is Radio ClashÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s insistent backbeat.\n\nHaters might cry Ã¢â‚¬Å“retroÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ but there are no false notes here. Like his dad, DylanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s earthy style never tried to jump on any trend or bandwagon. It makes this new material reminiscent of everything that has come before. More atmospheric elements like the story song of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Constellation BluesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ benefit from producer Jay JoyceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hands off style that keeps DylanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lyrics clear and upfront while the band lays down a throbbing undercurrent complete with mournful slide guitar. It mirrors the songÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s downbeat account of a small town soldier who questions his no-future life, told from the viewpoint of its disheartened protagonist. The demonic lyrics of Ã¢â‚¬Å“DevilÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s WaltzÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ are reflected in its ominous swamp beat, guitarist MathisÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ distorted solo and DylanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s leather tough singing. JaffeeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s keyboards, that have previously played a minor part in the albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sonics, lead the closing Ã¢â‚¬Å“One Set of Wings,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ urged on by new drummer Jack IronsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ (ex-Red Hot Chili Peppers) forceful attack.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:78a9fd2f53ca920d76cf8b2621540831964ad31e","amp;dn":"The+Wallflowers+-+Glad+All+Over+%282012%29%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"78a9fd2f53ca920d76cf8b2621540831964ad31e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,169,253,47,83,202,146,13,118,207,139,38,33,84,8,49,150,74,211,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
