To his admirers, he was a courageous advocate for the rights of African Americans, a man who indicted white America in the harshest terms for its crimes against black Americans. Detractors accused him of preaching racism, black supremacy, antisemitism, and violence. He has been called one of the greatest and most influential African Americans in history.\n\nMalcolm X's father diedÃ¢â‚¬â€killed by white supremacists, it was rumoredÃ¢â‚¬â€when he was young, and at least one of his uncles was lynched. When he was thirteen, his mother was placed in a mental hospital, and he was placed in a series of foster homes. In 1946, at age 20, he went to prison for breaking and entering.\n\nIn prison, Malcolm X became a member of the Nation of Islam and after his parole in 1952 he quickly rose to become one of its leaders. For a dozen years Malcolm X was the public face of the controversial group, but disillusionment with Nation of Islam head Elijah Muhammad led him to leave the Nation in March 1964. After a period of travel in Africa and the Middle East, he returned to the United States, where he founded Muslim Mosque, Inc. and the Organization of Afro-American Unity. In February 1965, less than a year after leaving the Nation of Islam, he was assassinated by three members of the group.\n\nMalcolm X's expressed beliefs changed substantially over time. As a spokesman for the Nation of Islam he taught black supremacy and advocated separation of black and white AmericansÃ¢â‚¬â€in contrast to the civil rights movement's emphasis on integration. After breaking with the Nation of Islam in 1964Ã¢â‚¬â€saying of his association with it, &quot;I was a zombie then ... pointed in a certain direction and told to march&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€and becoming a Sunni Muslim, he disavowed racism and expressed willingness to work with civil rights leaders, though still emphasizing black self-determination and self defense.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2cf0a6826f9abd93ab4828b71ecf17be9369a7a1","amp;dn":"The+Speeches+of+Malcolm+X+%28VHS%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2cf0a6826f9abd93ab4828b71ecf17be9369a7a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,240,166,130,111,154,189,147,171,72,40,183,30,207,23,190,147,105,167,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
