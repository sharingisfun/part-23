Rather than bore her with the inanities of everyday life, Calhoun reads from an old, faded notebook containing the sweeping account of a young couple (Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams) whose love affair was tragically put to a halt after their separation in the midst of World War II. Seven years later, the couple was reunited, and, despite having taken radically different paths, they found themselves unable to resist the call of a second chance. The Notebook also features Joan Allen, Sam Shepard, and Kevin Connolly.\n\n\n                                Mpaa Rating++++++++++\n\n                         Rated PG-13 for some sexuality.\n\n\n                                Retail Release Date++++++++\n\n                        25 June 2004\n\n                                DVD Content++++++++++\n\n                             \n                 Main Movie+++++++++++++++\n\t              +Video- Untouched\n\t              +Audio-English\n                          +Subs-English, Spanish\n\n\n                 Menu+++++++\n\t              +Yes\t\n              \n                 Extras/Special Features+++++\n\t              +Yes\n\n                 Removed++++++++++++++\n\t              FBI crap and trailers and all of the other annoying and useless stuff.\n\n\n\n                 Chapters++++++++++++++\n\n1.
