These artists were Barry Windsor-Smith, Jeff Jones, Michael William Kaluta and Bernie Wrightson.\n\nBy 1979 they had produced enough material to issue an art book under the name The Studio, which was published by Dragon's Dream. The members of The Studio moved on to independent projects and domiciles thereafter.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:49fa4023e5f9c23ddb6fba7cfeb28cad733f0589","amp;dn":"The+Studio+-+Michael+Kaluta%2C+Barry+Windsor-Smith+%26amp%3B+more%21%21","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"49fa4023e5f9c23ddb6fba7cfeb28cad733f0589","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,250,64,35,229,249,194,61,219,111,186,124,254,178,140,173,115,63,5,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
