Will you use it for good? Being totally altruistic may not be the best business plan. The uncomfortable truth (is there an ointment for that?) is that some remedies are more profitable than others and illness is good for business.\nWelcome to the world of Big Pharma!\nWith a few rusty reconditioned machines, you can progress from knocking out cheap generic treatments for minor ailments, to discovering new active ingredients and hi-tech machines to help refine the next generation of world-changing drugs.\nBut watch out, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re not alone out there. Rival corporations that want to put you out of business have their own set of competing cures and treatments.\nThen thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the dynamically shifting marketplace which means that your fancy cold and flu medicine from last winter might not sell so well now itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the height of summer. Where did I put my anti-wrinkle sun cream?\nBig Pharma is part business sim, part logistics puzzle. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s one thing to work away in the lab perfecting new formulas, but converting the Ã¢â‚¬Ëœsciency stuffÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ into cold hard cash means bringing an engineering and business mind to the problem.\nFactory space is expensive, and those fancy new agglomerators and centrifuges donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t always slot nicely together.\nThe first PC strategy game that lets you make money from curing disease!\nUnique blend of puzzle &amp; strategy as you build intricate production lines for your drugs.\nAdaptive AI each with their own individual personalities attempt to beat you to market with the best cures.\n\nMinimum system requirements - Windows: Windows XP / 7 / 8 / 10\nProcessor: 2 GHz Dual Core\nGraphics: GeForce 600 series or better\nHard drive space: 2 GB\nDirectX: 9.0c\nMouse &amp; Keyboard\n\nRecommended system requirements - Windows: Windows XP / 7 / 8 / 10\nProcessor: 2 GHz Quad Core\nGraphics: GeForce 700 series or better\nHard drive space: 2 GB\nDirectX: 9.0c\nMouse &amp; Keyboard","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d00f06d0e5d4010f587fc0c83316971a0475e438","amp;dn":"Big+Pharma+%28GOG%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d00f06d0e5d4010f587fc0c83316971a0475e438","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,15,6,208,229,212,1,15,88,127,192,200,51,22,151,26,4,117,228,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
