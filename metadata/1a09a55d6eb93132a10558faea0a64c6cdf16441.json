But not all know how to craft great code - code that is well written and easy to understand. Code Craft teaches programmers how to move beyond writing correct code to writing great code. The book covers code writing concerns, including code presentation style, variable naming, error handling, and security; and the wider issues of programming in the real world, such as good teamwork, development processes, and documentation. Code Craft presents language-agnostic advice that is relevant to all developers, from an author with loads of practical experience. A Q&amp;A section at the end of each chapter helps readers to review the material and makes the book suited for academic use as well.\nFrom the Back Cover\nYou know how to write code that works, but what about code that's well written and easy to understand? And robust and bug-free? If other programmers looked at your handiwork, would they be able to figure out the code's logic and purpose? Exceptional programmers have more than just technical know-how; they adopt the right approach and attitude to development.\n\nCode Craft will help take your programming beyond writing correct code to writing great code, thus turning you into a true programming professional or enhancing your existing professional skills.\n\nWith language-agnostic advice that's relevant to all developers, Code Craft covers code-writing concerns such as presentation style, variable naming, error handling, and security. And it tackles broader, real-world programming issues like effective teamwork, development processes, and documentation. Each chapter ends with a Q&amp;A section that reviews key concepts to get you thinking like an expert, making it an especially great reference for newer programmers who want to work professionally and efficiently as part of a team.\n\nThis survival guide for the software factory will show you how to:\n* Write good code when the world's not helping you\n* Avoid disasters and distractions in the workplace\n* Assess your abilities accurately and determine ways to improve\n* Adopt productive attitudes and follow best practices\n\nThere's little more valuable than the advice of a true, programming professional. You'll find Code Craft to be clear, practical, and entertaining throughout, and a great way to take your code (and your career) to the next level.\nSee all Editorial Reviews\nProduct Details\n\n    * Paperback: 624 pages\n    * Publisher: No Starch Press; 1st Ed. edition (December 15, 2006)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 1593271190\n    * ISBN-13: 978-1593271190","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a09a55d6eb93132a10558faea0a64c6cdf16441","amp;dn":"Code+Craft+-+The+Practice+of+Writing+Excellent+Code%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a09a55d6eb93132a10558faea0a64c6cdf16441","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,9,165,93,110,185,49,50,161,5,88,250,234,10,100,198,205,241,100,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
