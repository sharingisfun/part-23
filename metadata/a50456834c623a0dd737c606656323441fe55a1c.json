The series centered on events involving the second platoon of the fictional company &quot;K&quot; of the US Army infantry. The action began with their experiences at the D day landing on the beaches of Normandy in France and continued with their experiences fighting their way on to Berlin and the end of the war in Europe. The series was extremely popular and was nominated for 3 Emmy awards. The action changed each week with the same regular cast including Vic Morrow as Sgt. Chip Saunders the platoon Sergeant. Rick Jason as Lt. Gil Hanley the platoon leader. Each week a new &quot;guest star&quot; was introduced that would appear in that week's episode only as a significant character in that week's story. Each of the &quot;guest stars&quot; were prominent veteran actors and actresses from film or television shows of the period. While each episode usually involved a good deal of action, the prime focus was on the human element of the events. The prospective was typically seen from that of the men or women who were engaged with the fighting of the war. This provided a good prospective of the GI's personal insight into the events and consequently their feelings regarding the war","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a50456834c623a0dd737c606656323441fe55a1c","amp;dn":"Combat+-+Season+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a50456834c623a0dd737c606656323441fe55a1c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,4,86,131,76,98,58,13,215,55,198,6,101,99,35,68,31,229,90,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
