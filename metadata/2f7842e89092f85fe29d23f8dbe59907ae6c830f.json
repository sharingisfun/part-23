While this is an \n\nanniversary concert, it is still typical of a concert by the group.\n\nI have edited this into two different groups.  The first part is edited by song omitting the applause.  This \n\nwas done if you wish to put it on a mp3 player.  I edited out the applause due to the fact I hate it! In the \n\nUnedited folder you will find the album &quot;as is&quot; without any editing except for the deletion of silence before \n\nand after a track.\n\nTracks (Roman numerals indicate the Unedited version)\nI.  Songs of the Renaissance\n\t1. La Guerre (The War by Jannequin)\n\t2. This Sweet and Merry Month of May (William Byrd)\n\t3. Come Sirrah Jack Ho! (Thomas Weelkes)\n\t4. Fair Phyllis I Saw Sitting All Alone (John Farmer)\n\t5. Contrappunto Bestiale Alla Mente (The Animals Sing Counterpoint by Adriano Banchieri)\n\t6. Valle, Che De Lamenti Miei (That my Valle Laments by Giaches de Wert)\n\nII. Quatre Petites Prieres de Saint Francois D'Assise (Four Small Prayers of St. Francis of Assisi by Poulenc)\n\t(Note the group sings these as one)\n\t7. Salut, Dame Sainte\n\t   Tout puissant Dieu\n\t   Seigneur, je vous en prie\n\t   O mes tres chers freres\n\nIII. Lalela Zulu (Music by Stanley Glasser Words by Lewis Nkosi)\n\t8.
