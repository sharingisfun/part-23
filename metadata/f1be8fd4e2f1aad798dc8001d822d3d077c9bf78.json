These scholars are poisoned by the feudal imperial examination. \nOn their way to success, some of them become mad and aberration; some of them get chinchy; some of them go rotted and currupt. They desert their first wife, turn into ungrateful and mean flunkies although originally they are poor.\nThere are kind and honesty countrymen as well, through whom the author showed his feelings towards populace. \nThe Scholars is made up of many units, each of which can exist separately.\n\nEnjoy and please seed !!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f1be8fd4e2f1aad798dc8001d822d3d077c9bf78","amp;dn":"The+Scholars-Wu+Jingzi.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f1be8fd4e2f1aad798dc8001d822d3d077c9bf78","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,190,143,212,226,241,170,215,152,220,128,1,216,34,211,208,119,201,191,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
