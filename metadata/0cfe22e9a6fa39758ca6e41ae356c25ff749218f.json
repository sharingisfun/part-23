The song is a remix of a tune from the 1984 Commodore 64 game Lazy Jones by David Whittaker called &quot;Stardust&quot;. Soon after the first independent release in 1999, the song became an underground hit in European clubs, and was licensed to various countries including a more commercial remix version by Italian remix-producer DJ Gius.\n\nThe song, specifically the &quot;Sport Chant Remix&quot;, is popular at North American sporting events for goals and other celebrations. It is believed that the first use was at Marquette University in 2002.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0cfe22e9a6fa39758ca6e41ae356c25ff749218f","amp;dn":"Zombie+Nation+-+Kernkraft+400+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0cfe22e9a6fa39758ca6e41ae356c25ff749218f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,254,34,233,166,250,57,117,140,166,228,26,227,86,194,95,247,73,33,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
