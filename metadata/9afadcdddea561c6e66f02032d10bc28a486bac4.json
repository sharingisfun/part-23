Enjoy ! \n\nGROUP NEWS \n\nAfter three and a half years of supporting the scene with \nquality releases, ACME is proud to break the barrier of 5000 \nreleases, more than 3600 of them being keymakers. \n\nAs you may have noticed we always try our best to keep a high \nlevel of quality. Therefore we do not take part in mass \nreleasing like midnight-mu-races or converter/ripper-shareware, \nwhich gets released from different vendors with same look, \nfuntionality, version number and of course same serial over and \nover. We tend to care for quality before quantity. \n\nFinally we would like to thank our hardworking members, friends \nand all people, who are affiliated to us. \n\nGreetings fly out to all the groups who care for quality, \nloyalty, respect and security: Keep your azz clean ! \n\nDiSCLAiMER \n\nREAD THIS CAREFULLY \n\nACME can not be held responsible for any unlawful actions based on \nor in conjunction with any of its releases. The enduser has to \ndecide whether to download, install, and use a release or not. \nSoftware engineers have to spend a lot of time developing their \nprograms to improve their products in order to get new custo- \nmers and to make a living.
