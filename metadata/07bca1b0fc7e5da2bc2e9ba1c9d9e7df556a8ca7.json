Jeremy investigates tales of frighteningly large and dangerous river monsters that have attacked and even killed humans. In this season, Wade catches the most bizarre and dangerous underwater creatures to inhabit earth, including a monster responsible for devouring certain male body parts in Papua New Guinea, and packs of eels that will rip the flesh from unfortunate swimmers. Jeremy s search for the truth takes him on a dark and dangerous journey across the globe to reveal that the truth is every bit as unbelievable as the myth.\n&quot;Perhaps my favorite part about River Monsters is that the program is entirely aware of the dangers that exist outside of the water when traveling to different continents. Jeremy Wade is always very culturally aware, and often has to tread thin lines when investigating animals in extreme locations. He is always eager to seek local knowledge, respect tradition and utilize the assistance of the community. When speaking to those who have suffered loss or injury he is sympathetic, yet composed and persevering.&quot;\n\n\n1)  The Mutilator \nJeremy Wade travels to Papua New Guinea to investigate a spate of bizarre deaths on one of the world's last great unexplored rivers, the Sepik. A creature there is tearing chunks from unsuspecting fishermen and devouring certain male body parts. Jeremy has never fished in this part of the world and knows little of what might be there. Nothing could prepare him for what he discovers.\n\n2)  Flesh Ripper \nJeremy Wade is on the trail of a mysterious man-eater. New Zealand's freshwaters have been a safe place for swimmers, yet as Jeremy finds out, its remote rivers and deep lakes provide refuge for an ancient and slippery predator that can stay hidden for more than a century. To flush one out, he must put himself on the menu.\n\n3)  Silent Assassin \nJeremy Wade travels to the ParanÃƒÂ¡ River in the remote northeast corner of Argentina to investigate the death of a young girl. Once there, he discovers a second death. The people who live along this river bank fear the creature they call &quot;River Dog.&quot; This is a new species to Jeremy, a river monster that somehow got under his radar. His discovery is not only the most alien of all river monsters, it is also the largest totally freshwater river monster Jeremy ever has caught!\n\n4)  Chainsaw Predator \nJeremy Wade heads to a remote river in the Australian Outback to try and catch the rare but fearsome freshwater sawfish. This shadowy predator is reputed to reach 18 feet long and attacks boats - but does the fact that it could slash Jeremy to shreds make it a killer? And why is this bizarre-looking sea monster swimming hundreds of miles inland?\n\n5)  Electric Executioner \nJeremy Wade travels to Brazil's &quot;wild west&quot; in search of a river monster that has killed three cowboys. The search for the culprit sends him deep into prospecting cattle country, where he discovers the shocking truth about a fish he's never caught before. He has to combat all his fears to catch this monster, and after a long chase, Jeremy finally corners his elusive prey in the most unexpected place. All he has to do then is catch it without getting killed.\n\n6)  Cold Blooded Horror \nHaving never been to Japan, Jeremy Wade is entering new territory in more ways than one. The river monsters there are like no others he ever has encountered, from the devastating &quot;Namazu,&quot; which legend says causes earthquakes, to a child-snatching killer called the &quot;Kappa.&quot; Can our extreme fisherman uncover the truth behind these legends? Can he catch a monster in the rivers of Japan that reveals the reality behind these horrific tales? He is about to find out.\n\n7)  Jungle Killer \nJeremy Wade sets out to discover the true river monster of South America. Piranhas get all the press, but is there a more fearsome predator lurking in its rivers? Tipped off by an account of an attack on a diver, Jeremy soon discovers that there is a real monster to find. Tipped off by the local Amerindian tribe, Jeremy heads deeper and deeper into the remote jungles of Suriname to come face to face with a jungle killer like no other.\n\n8)  Tribal Fishing \nJeremy Wade attempts to survive alongside some of the world's best tribal fishermen using spears, bows and arrows, and even spiders webs to catch his prey. These master fishermen live in a tropical island paradise, where they fish and swim in some of the most shark-infested waters on the planet. As Jeremy throws himself into South Pacific tribal life, he comes closer than ever to one of the world's ultimate predator.\n\n9)  The Lost Reels Part 1: Amazon \nThis two-part special - featuring long-lost footage never before seen by U.S. audiences - captures some of the biggest moments in Jeremy Wade's life. Journey back to 2002 in part one, &quot;Amazon,&quot; as Jeremy searches for one of the world's largest freshwater fish: the Arapaima.\n\n10)  The Lost Reels Part 2: India \nIn the Second part of this special - featuring long-lost footage never before seen by U.S. audiences &quot;India,&quot; Jeremy travels to India in 2005 in search of a man-eating catfish called the Goonch.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img809.imageshack.us/img809/1540/rivermonstersseries3scr.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img809.imageshack.us/img809/1540/rivermonstersseries3scr.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img14.imageshack.us/img14/1540/rivermonstersseries3scr.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img14.imageshack.us/img14/1540/rivermonstersseries3scr.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img132.imageshack.us/img132/1540/rivermonstersseries3scr.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img132.imageshack.us/img132/1540/rivermonstersseries3scr.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img713.imageshack.us/img713/1540/rivermonstersseries3scr.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img713.imageshack.us/img713/1540/rivermonstersseries3scr.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img694.imageshack.us/img694/1540/rivermonstersseries3scr.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img694.imageshack.us/img694/1540/rivermonstersseries3scr.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img26.imageshack.us/img26/1540/rivermonstersseries3scr.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img26.imageshack.us/img26/1540/rivermonstersseries3scr.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img707.imageshack.us/img707/1540/rivermonstersseries3scr.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img707.imageshack.us/img707/1540/rivermonstersseries3scr.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img818.imageshack.us/img818/1540/rivermonstersseries3scr.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img818.imageshack.us/img818/1540/rivermonstersseries3scr.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img819.imageshack.us/img819/1540/rivermonstersseries3scr.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img819.imageshack.us/img819/1540/rivermonstersseries3scr.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;95ddfcf2fdd5d9a6bba4&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n * Video Bitrate: 2125 Kbps\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.778 (16:9)\n * Video Resolution: 832 x 468\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 Kbps CBR 48KHz\n * Audio Channels: 2\n * Run-Time: 45mins\n * Framerate: 29fps\n * Number of Parts: 10\n * Part Size: 619 MB\n * Container: mp4\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n * Source: DVD\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://animal.discovery.com/tv-shows/river-monsters/about-this-show/about-river-monsters.htmThe&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://animal.discovery.com/tv-shows/river-monsters/about-this-show/about-river-monsters.htmThe&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:07bca1b0fc7e5da2bc2e9ba1c9d9e7df556a8ca7","amp;dn":"Discovery+Ch+River+Monsters+Series+3+01of10+The+Mutilator+DVDrip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"07bca1b0fc7e5da2bc2e9ba1c9d9e7df556a8ca7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,188,161,176,252,126,93,162,188,46,155,161,201,217,231,223,85,106,140,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
