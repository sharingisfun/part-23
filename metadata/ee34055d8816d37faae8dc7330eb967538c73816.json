Duncton Wood has been made into a colony for mole outcasts, yet it is here that Beechan, the Stone Mole, is born. His task is to show all moles how the Stone's silence may be known. Along the way, dark forces of evil are unleashed against him, and he will need the help of other moles if he is to survive. He will also need the love of one other mole if there is ever to be a Duncton Found. \n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee34055d8816d37faae8dc7330eb967538c73816","amp;dn":"3+Duncton+Found+-+William+Horwood","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee34055d8816d37faae8dc7330eb967538c73816","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,52,5,93,136,22,211,127,170,232,220,115,48,235,150,117,56,199,56,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
