A Jew, he was born in the village of Kalischt, Bohemia, in what was then the Austrian Empire, now KaliÃ…Â¡tÃ„â€º in the Czech Republic. His family later moved to nearby Iglau (now Jihlava), where Mahler grew up.\n\nAs a composer, Mahler acted as a bridge between the 19th-century Austro-German tradition and the modernism of the early 20th century. While in his lifetime his status as a conductor was established beyond question, his own music gained wide popularity only after periods of relative neglect which included a ban on its performance in much of Europe during the Nazi era. After 1945 the music was discovered and championed by a new generation of listeners; Mahler then became a frequently performed and recorded composer, a position he has sustained into the 21st century.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustav_Mahler&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustav_Mahler&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imslp.org/wiki/Category:Mahler,_Gustav&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imslp.org/wiki/Category:Mahler,_Gustav&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf068fadf33fcac12d2a0546675b38acabfd2f21","amp;dn":"Gustav+Mahler+Complete+Sheet+Music+PDF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf068fadf33fcac12d2a0546675b38acabfd2f21","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,6,143,173,243,63,202,193,45,42,5,70,103,91,56,172,171,253,47,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
