You can find videos on YouTube where you will see them try a variety of things to capture your attention, from the manic literal interpretation of the band name in &quot;Thats The Way&quot; to the use of McQuades legs in &quot;Shout&quot; to the moody stylings of &quot;Walking in the Dark&quot; (which is a standout hit on this album). It seems there were a multitude of other musicians over the bands few years of recording but only Clifforth and McQuade hung in there until 1985 when a full album was finally released. Great fun, very synth-poppy and a perfect &quot;Why havent I heard this before&quot; kind of album.\n\nTracks :\n01 &quot;Fight for Love&quot; (Wenban, Clifforth)\n02 &quot;Can't Stop the Motor&quot; (Clifforth)\n03 &quot;It's All in the Game&quot; (Charles Dawes, Carl Sigman)\n04 &quot;I Need You More&quot; (Hester, Clifforth)\n05 &quot;Love Takes Over&quot; (Clifforth)\n06 &quot;Every Other Day&quot; (Clifforth)\n07 &quot;Teach Me to Cry&quot; (Clifforth)\n08 &quot;I Get Hungry&quot; (Clifforth)\n09 &quot;Overboard&quot; (Clifforth)\n10 &quot;Walking in the Dark&quot; (Clifforth)\n\nMusicians : \nJohn Clifforth vocals, keyboards \nCathy McQuade vocals, bass, keyboards\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bfa80489fd6ace1224e8628eeb790eef64b70203","amp;dn":"Deckchairs+Overboard+%281985%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bfa80489fd6ace1224e8628eeb790eef64b70203","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,168,4,137,253,106,206,18,36,232,98,142,235,121,14,239,100,183,2,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
