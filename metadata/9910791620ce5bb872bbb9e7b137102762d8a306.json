Nik (Tristan Halilaj) is a carefree teenager in a small town with a crush on the school beauty and ambitions to start his own internet cafÃƒÂ©. His world is suddenly up-ended when his father and uncle become entangled in a land dispute that leaves a fellow villager murdered. According to a centuries-old code of law, this entitles the dead man's family to take the life of a male from Nik's family as retribution. His uncle in jail and his father in hiding, Nik is the prime target and confined to the home while his younger sister Rudina (Sindi LaÃƒÂ§ej) is forced to leave school and take over their father's business. \n\n\n\nLanguage: Albanian\n\nSubs srt: Portuguese / English / Spanish\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9910791620ce5bb872bbb9e7b137102762d8a306","amp;dn":"The+Forgiveness+of+Blood+2011+DVDRip+Sonata+Premiere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9910791620ce5bb872bbb9e7b137102762d8a306","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,16,121,22,32,206,91,184,114,187,185,231,177,55,16,39,98,216,163,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
