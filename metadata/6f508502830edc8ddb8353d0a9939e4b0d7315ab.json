Both the original and the 1933 film made a great deal of money for Warner Bros., and Gold Diggers of 1935 was an attempt to repeat that success. It was followed by Gold Diggers of 1937 and Gold Diggers in Paris.\n\n    CAST:-\n    Dick Powell as Dick Curtis\n    Adolphe Menjou as Nicolai Nicoleff\n    Gloria Stuart as Ann Prentiss\n    Alice Brady as Matilda Prentiss\n    Hugh Herbert as T.

It opens with a head shot of singer Wini Shaw against a black background, then the camera pulls back and up, and Shaw's head becomes the Big Apple, New York City. As everyone rushes off to work, Shaw returns home from her night's carousing and goes to sleep. When she awakens, that night, we follow her and her beau (Dick Powell) from club to club, with elaborate large cast tap numbers, until she is pushed off a balcony to her death. The sequence ends with a return to Shaw's head, as she sings the end of the song.\n\nDANCE CONTENTS:-\n-- Dance of hotel workers, perf. by the ensemble \n-- Rehearsals of dagger and swan dances, perf. by Menjou and ensemble \n-- &quot;The words are in my heart&quot; production number includes dances by the female ensemble and a female soloist \n-- &quot;Lullaby of Broadway&quot; production number, perf. by Powell, Shaw, and ensemble, includes an exhibition ballroom dancing number by RamoÃ‚Â´n and Rosita, and a tap dance by the ensemble. \n\nPRODUCTION NOTES:-\nGold Diggers of 1935 was in production at Warner Bros. Burbank studios until 14 January 1935, and was released on 15 March of that year. \nDuring production a chorus dancer, Jack Grieves, died on the set due to acute indigestion.\n\nThe film was Busby Berkeley's first time at the helm of a film as the official director, although he had his own unit at Warners to do the elaborate production numbers he conceived, designed, staged and directed, which were the major elements of the Warners musicals of that period.\n\nSYNOPSIS:- Gold Diggers of 1935\nIn the resort of Lake Waxapahachie, the swanky Wentworth Plaza is where the rich all congregate, and where the tips flow like wine. Handsome Dick Curtis (Dick Powell) is working his way through medical school as a desk clerk, and when rich, penny-pinching Mrs. Prentiss (Alice Brady) offers to pay him to escort her daughter Ann (Gloria Stuart) for the summer, Dick can't say no Ã¢â‚¬â€œ even his fiancee, Arline Davis (Dorothy Dare) thinks he should do it. Mrs. Prentiss wants Ann to marry eccentric middle-aged millionaire T. Mosley Thorpe (Hugh Herbert), who's a world-renowned expert on snuffboxes, but Ann has other ideas. Meanwhile her brother, Humbolt (Frank McHugh) has a weakness for a pretty face: he's been married and bought out of trouble by his mother several times.\n\nEvery summer, Mrs. Prentiss produces a charity show for the &quot;Milk Fund&quot;, and this year she hires the flamboyant and conniving Russian dance director Nicolai Nicoleff (Adolphe Menjou) to direct the show. The parsimonious Mrs. Prentiss wants to spend the least amount possible, but Nicoleff and his set designer Schultz (Joseph Cawthorn) want to be as extravagant as they can, so they can rake off more money for themselves, and for the hotel manager (Grant Mitchell) and the hotel stenographer (Glenda Farrell), who's blackmailing the hapless snuffbox fancier Thorpe.\n\nOf course, Dick and Ann fall in love, Humbolt marries Arline, and the show ends up costing Mrs. Prentiss an arm and a leg, but in the end she realizes that having a doctor in the family will save money in the long run.\n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:-\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 855 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 640x480\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 23.976\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams:  2\nAudio Languages:English\nRunTime 95 mins\nSubtitles: None\nRipped by: Trinidad [DDR]\nDuration: 95 mins","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f508502830edc8ddb8353d0a9939e4b0d7315ab","amp;dn":"Gold+Diggers+of+1935+Xvid+1cd+-+A+Busby+Berkeley+Collection+-+Cl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f508502830edc8ddb8353d0a9939e4b0d7315ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,80,133,2,131,14,220,141,219,131,83,208,169,147,158,75,13,115,21,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
