Extensions can be accessed through the Toolbox or via the Insert menu just like the standard objects. In the future we plan to release a wide range of extensions to make WYSIWYG Web Builder even more powerful than it already is. Some extensions are simply components with few parameters while other are almost complete applications by themselves...\n\nNotes: \nExtensions are only available for registered users!   (yeah right... ;) )\nExtensions are not officially supported, they are made available as an extra service for the users of WYSIWYG Web Builder and the software is provided &quot;AS IS&quot;.\n\nInstall:\nExtract .zip extension to some temp directory then copy resulting .wbx file to &quot;WYSIWYG Web Builder 5&quot; directory.\nAfter you have restarted the software, extensions will be available in toolbox.\nNote : The current version of WYSIWYG Web Builder supports a maximum of 50 extensions. It is not recommend to install unused extensions because this will take up unnecessary memory and may slow down the application.\n\n========================================================\n\n- Google Search : Adds Google Free Search functionality to your website.\n\n- Google Text\t: Create logo's just like the one on www.google.com!\n\n- HaloText\t: Adds text with the halo/aura effect to your page.\n\n- HTML TextBox\t: Probably the most advanced and powerful extension weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve ever created...\n\n- LightBox\t: Lightbox implements a cool way to display pictures on your web site.\n\n- Logo\t\t: Create amazing logo's for just website with only a few mouse clicks!\n\n- Password Protect : This extension adds very simple password protection to your web page.\n\n- Photo Album\t: The Photo Album extension introduces yet another cool way to display pictures on your web site!\n\n- PHP File Listing : This extension generates a listing of the contents of a specified directory on your web site.\n\n- PHP Guestbook\t : Use this extension to add a PHP guestbook to your website without any coding!\n\n- QuickList\t : Quickly create a combobox/listbox with a large number of items (like countries or states)\n\n- Random Image\t : Displays a different image every time a user visits your website.\n\n- RSS Feed\t : Add a RSS Feed to your website in only a few mouse clicks!\n\n- RSS Parser\t : Takes information from a given RSS feed (from another website) and displays the data on your web page.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nD.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6bb6ed6eca66db5a05c4736fcad44d36f0aa4cb3","amp;dn":"WYSIWYG+Web+Builder+v5.5x+-+Extensions+for+Reg+Users.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6bb6ed6eca66db5a05c4736fcad44d36f0aa4cb3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,182,237,110,202,102,219,90,5,196,115,111,202,212,77,54,240,170,76,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
