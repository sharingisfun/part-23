He observes a surreal wedding in which the bride and her family stand on one shore and the groom and his relatives on the other, lost under a cold sky: figure in a landscape who only delude themselves that they are masters of the earth and their destiny The town, a remote ghost town, almost forgotten at the end of the world, has been named Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â«waiting roomÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â» by the locals because most of its inhabitants are refugees from different countries many of whom have crossed the border illegally at some time or other and are now waiting for their turn to leave and start life anew Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â«somewhere else. In the course of his investigation he also comes upon an aging, reclusive refugee, who lives there cultivating a field. But the young journalist believes he is a famous Greek politician who disappeared years before, leaving behind him many unanswered questions. The man's identity is never resolved but the hapless refugees and divided village allow the reporter to understand his despair over the human condition.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img6.imageshack.us/img6/1644/vlcsnap14435.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img6.imageshack.us/img6/1644/vlcsnap14435.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img27.imageshack.us/img27/9867/vlcsnap14732.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img27.imageshack.us/img27/9867/vlcsnap14732.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img22.imageshack.us/img22/5608/vlcsnap15040.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img22.imageshack.us/img22/5608/vlcsnap15040.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img27.imageshack.us/img27/4893/vlcsnap16619.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img27.imageshack.us/img27/4893/vlcsnap16619.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img18.imageshack.us/img18/4886/vlcsnap16115.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img18.imageshack.us/img18/4886/vlcsnap16115.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n-------not my rip----\n\n~~~~~~  To metewro vhma tou pelargou.avi ~~~~~~                                     \n                                                               \nFile Size (in bytes):...........................1,467,254,784                     \n                                                                                \n--- Video Information ---                                                       \nVideo Codec Name:...............................XviD 1.0.2              \nDuration (hh:mm:ss):............................2:16:34                \nFrame Count:....................................196460             \nFrame Width (pixels):...........................720                  \nFrame Height (pixels):..........................416                  \nAspect Ratio:...................................1.731                     \nFrames Per Second:..............................23.976          \nVideo Bitrate (kbps):...........................1300                 \n......MPEG-4..............................                    \nQuality Factor (bits/pixel)/frame:..............0.181&quot;                     \n                                                                                \n--- Audio Information ---                                                       \nAudio Codec:....................................0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3                   \nAudio Sample Rate (Hz):.........................48000             \nAudio Bitrate(kbps):............................119                 \nAudio Bitrate Type (&quot;CBR&quot; or &quot;VBR&quot;):............VBR            \nAudio Channel Count:............................2           \n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
