There actually was a comic book series called Avengers Unplugged, and it survived for six whole issues before Marvel mercifully pulled the plug on it. It was a new monthly companion title to the ongoing Avengers series, only with considerably poorer story and art (which is saying something given how much the parent title had degenerated by late 1995). It was part of Marvel's ill-fated 99-cent economy line, though the content was even cheaper than the cover price: the plots were lame, the dialogue worse, and the art worse than that half the time; it was also an unusually sexist and sophomoric series, even for a comic book--the sort of stuff you're embarrassed to have in your collection. It was an honest-to-gosh Avengers series, though, so it bears scrutiny for the sake of completism.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d1111b8e9b95f74faacb4329d4661e267182f1a","amp;dn":"Avengers+-+Unplugged+%2801+-+06%29+%28-+Nem+-%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d1111b8e9b95f74faacb4329d4661e267182f1a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,17,17,184,233,185,95,116,250,172,180,50,157,70,97,226,103,24,47,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
