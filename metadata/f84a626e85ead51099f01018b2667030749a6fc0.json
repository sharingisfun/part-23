Tensions -- already high with greedy relatives appearing to claim their inheritances -- are further strained by the appearance of the dying woman's long-lost son, who ran away 18 years ago. His mother greets him with joy, the relatives with resentment, but the woman alone knows he is hiding something...that he is not who he says he is. As she uncovers secrets and deceptions of the past and present, she knows only one thing in her heart -- that the irresistible appeal and seductive power of this mysterious stranger may be more dangerous than she thinks!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f84a626e85ead51099f01018b2667030749a6fc0","amp;dn":"Anne+Stuart+-+Shadow+Lover","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f84a626e85ead51099f01018b2667030749a6fc0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,74,98,110,133,234,213,16,153,240,16,24,178,102,112,48,116,154,111,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
