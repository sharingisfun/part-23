Together they play this\nabsolute wonderful CD of free improvisation, called &quot;Cette OpacitÃƒÂ©&quot;, played at\nthe Jazzdor Festival of Strasbourg in France in 2003. The two musicians play\nsome fabulously fresh, raw, inventive and fun music. The melodies are great,\nthe rhythms are stunning, the interplay is remarkable. Foltz's playing at times\nreminds me of Ned Rothenberg, and true, both are experts in the circular\nbreathing technique, but here Chevillon's bass gives it a more haunting and\nhypnotic quality. Yet there is joy too, and plenty of it, and suprise, and\nmelancholy moments too. Apart from their stunning musicianship, their sense of\nspace and silence is excellent as well. As said, a wonderful album.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b6de5c78d1d625e1d4b87644394ee5cf8705025","amp;dn":"Jean-Marc+Foltz%2C+Bruno+Chevillon+-+Cette+Opacite+%282005%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b6de5c78d1d625e1d4b87644394ee5cf8705025","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,109,229,199,141,29,98,94,29,75,135,100,67,148,238,92,248,112,80,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
