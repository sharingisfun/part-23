Smith from The Institute for Responsible Technology, which is an Oregon based 501(c)(3) nonprofit, tax-exempt charitable organization.\n\nThis is much needed to know information about GMO (Genetically Modified Organism) food and how it is damaging our society.\n\nI just finished listening to it in my car, so I will not cover to much, just listen to it. He discusses studies on how GMO soybean has been tested on animals and how it has been proven to kill them, has made them not be able to reproduce offspring. He discussed how in Europe there was a huge public outcry about GMO foods in food and after a big study, big companies such as McDonalds and other fastfood chains removed GMO foods from all of their products, yet because in the United States not enough people are aware of the dangers of GMO food in their diet, they have not banned them in the United States.\n\nit is NOT safe to change the DNA of food and to consume it. Have you ever thought that maybe if animals who are fed GMO food are having problems being able to reproduce offspring, maybe that is why now in the United States people are starting to have such big problems with not being able to have children? \n\nDownload this, it is in MP3 format. Listen to it in your car, your ipod, etc...\n\nShare this with your family, friends, educate others. \n\nThis excellent lecture is 1 hour and 13 minutes long.\n\nHere is a good video to watch as well","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa53ff4f05877ddd27351f3389764c674583541a","amp;dn":"The+ugly+truth+about+the+foods+you+eat%21+-+GMO+Foods+%5BMUST+DL%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa53ff4f05877ddd27351f3389764c674583541a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,83,255,79,5,135,125,221,39,53,31,51,137,118,76,103,69,131,84,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
