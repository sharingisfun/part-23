The first CMA awards were presented at an untelevised ceremony in Nashville's Municipal Auditorium in 1967. (The Entertainer of the Year award that night went to Eddy Arnold.) The second annual CMA awards were presented in October 1968; NBC taped the ceremony and broadcast it a few weeks later). Beginning in 1969, the awards were televised live, usually during October or November of each year. They continued to be broadcast on NBC until switching to CBS in 1972, where they remained until 2005. Starting in November 2006, the Annual CMA Awards are televised on ABC. The CMA Awards, for many years, were held at the home of Nashville's Grand Ole Opry; initially at the Ryman Auditorium, and from 1974 to 2004 at the Grand Ole Opry House. The 2005 ceremonies took place in New York City at Madison Square Garden. The awards show has been held at Nashville's Bridgestone Arena since 2006.\n\nAnnual awards are given in the following twelve categories: Entertainer, Male Vocalist, Female Vocalist, New Artist (previously known as the Horizon Award until 2008), Vocal Group, Vocal Duo (introduced in 1970), Single, Album, Song, Musical Event (split off from the Vocal Duo award in 1988 as Vocal Event), Music Video (introduced in 1985), and Musician. The distinction between the Duo and Event awards is that the former is presented to two artists who normally perform together, while the latter was specifically created to honor one-off collaborations.\n\n\n\nPerformers\n----------\nJason Aldean, Luke Bryan, Eric Church, Florida Georgia Line, Vince Gill, Dave Grohl, Hunter Hayes, Alan Jackson, Alison Krauss, Lady Antebellum, Miranda Lambert, Little Big Town, Tim McGraw, Jason Mraz, Kacey Musgraves, Jennifer Nettles, Brad Paisley, Rascal Flatts, Darius Rucker, Blake Shelton, Lennon &amp; Maisy Stella, George Strait, Taylor Swift, The Band Perry, Carrie Underwood, Keith Urban, and Zac Brown Band.\n\n\n\n\nSpecs:\n----------\nFile Types: Mkv\nVideo Codec: H264 - MPEG-4 AVC (part10)(avc1)\nLanguage: English\nResolution: 1280x720\nFrame Rate: 29.970628\nAudio Codec: A52 Audio  (aka AC3)(a52)\nChanels: 3F2R/LFE\nSample Rate: 48000 Hz\nBitrate: 384 kb/s\nSource: HDTV Rips\nAir Date: 11/06/2013\nTested with VLC on PC and WDTV Media Player on T.V.\n\n\nScreen Cap:\n---------- &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img14.imageshack.us/img14/1520/lcv1.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img14.imageshack.us/img14/1520/lcv1.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nActual Screenshots:\n----------  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img163.imageshack.us/img163/8224/nius.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img163.imageshack.us/img163/8224/nius.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img19.imageshack.us/img19/3554/fx00.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img19.imageshack.us/img19/3554/fx00.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img706.imageshack.us/img706/9105/qghn.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img706.imageshack.us/img706/9105/qghn.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img163.imageshack.us/img163/1907/w7cm.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img163.imageshack.us/img163/1907/w7cm.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img34.imageshack.us/img34/9007/r4vx.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img34.imageshack.us/img34/9007/r4vx.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nWiki: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_Music_Association_Awards&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_Music_Association_Awards&lt;/a&gt;\n\nOfficial Website: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.cmaworld.com/cma-awards/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.cmaworld.com/cma-awards/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIMDb link: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt2104102/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt2104102/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nMuch admiration to release groups and encoders such as 2HD, BS, IMMERSE, EVOLVE, CtrlHD, DHD, YesTV, MVGroup and KiNGS.\n\nBackups and other CARG releases can be found at ExtraTorrent, KickassTorrent and The Pirate Bay.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f0bdd8cc685d05653d3476c2ae4208b927c5e003","amp;dn":"47th+Annual+CMA+Awards+2013+720p+HD+%5BCARG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f0bdd8cc685d05653d3476c2ae4208b927c5e003","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,189,216,204,104,93,5,101,61,52,118,194,174,66,8,185,39,197,224,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
