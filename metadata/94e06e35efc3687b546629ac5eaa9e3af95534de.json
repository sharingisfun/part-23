A highly infectious disease has turned every living thing into zombies. Your neighbors will rend your flesh with their bare teeth. So will the rats. And if the rats don't, the squirrels will. Save yourself. Stay in the woods. Pray it hasn't reached the wolves...and keep your gun loaded.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:94e06e35efc3687b546629ac5eaa9e3af95534de","amp;dn":"Rebel+Blood+%5BComplete%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"94e06e35efc3687b546629ac5eaa9e3af95534de","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,224,110,53,239,195,104,123,84,102,41,172,94,170,158,58,249,85,52,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
