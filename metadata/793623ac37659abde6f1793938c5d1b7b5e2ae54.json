But seldom is the victim killed, much less shot twice, like Annette Botha. Piet Botha, the husband of the wealthy woman, is the primary suspect in his wife's murder.\n\nP.I. Jade de Jong fled South Africa ten years ago after her father was killed. Now back in town, she offers to help her father's former assistant, Superintendent David Patel, with his investigation of this case. Under apartheid, Patel, of Indian descent, could\nnever have attained his present position. But he is feeling pressure from his &quot;old line&quot; boss with respect to this investigation and fears lingering prejudice is at work.\n\nAs Jade probes into this and other recent car-jacking cases, a pattern begins to emerge, a pattern that goes back to her father's murder and that involves a vast and intricate series of crimes for profit.\n\nStolen Lives (Jade de Jong Series #2)\nWhen wealthy Pamela Jordaan hires PI Jade de Jong as a bodyguard after her husband Terrance disappears, Jade thinks keeping an eye on this anxious wife will be an easy way to earn some cash. But when a determined shooter nearly kills them both and Jade finds Terrance horrifically tortured and barely alive, she realizes that she has been drawn into a wicked game.\n\nAt the same time, her relationship with police superintendent David Patel is on the rocks, and things only get more complicated when his son is kidnapped and his wife is blackmailed. It soon becomes clear that the kidnapping and the attempted killings of Pamela and her husband are tied to a human trafficking ring that stretches from Johannesburg to London.\n\nThe Fallen (Jade de Jong Series #3)\nWhen P.I. Jade de Jong invites Superintendent David Patel on a scuba diving holiday in St. Lucia, she hopes the time away will rebuild their conflicted relationship. JadeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dreams are soon shattered when David calls off their affair, forcing her into the arms of environmentalist Craig Niewoudt. But the next morning, romantic issues are put aside when a scuba diving instructor, Amanda Bolton, is found brutally stabbed to death.\nAmanda is a most unlikely candidate for murderÃ¢â‚¬â€a quiet and intelligent woman who until a few months ago pursued a high-powered career as an air traffic controller. She had few acquaintances and no lovers. The only loose end is a postcard in her room from JoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢burg-based Themba Msamaya, asking how she is doing Ã¢â‚¬Å“after 813 and The Fallen.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Jade and David put their differences aside and start the deadly hunt.\n\nPale Horses (Jade de Jong Series #4)\nJohannesburg, South Africa: At first, the case appears to be one of simple misadventure. Sonet Meintjies, a base jumper, falls to her death while attempting to parachute off a newly built sixty-five-story skyscraper. But SonetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s jumping partner insists that this was no accident, and he hires private investigator Jade de Jong to uncover the truth.\n\nJade discovers that Sonet worked for a charity that helped impoverished communities become self-supporting farming units. When Jade travels out to the community farm in Limpopo, she finds it not just abandoned but razed to the ground. Digging deeper for answers about where the residents went, Jade learns about a fatal but unidentified disease that swept through the entire community. A deadly harvest has been gathered, and the person who knows the real truth about it has been forced to become collateral in its trade.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:793623ac37659abde6f1793938c5d1b7b5e2ae54","amp;dn":"Jade+de+Jong+Detective+Series+-+Jassy+Mackenzie","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"793623ac37659abde6f1793938c5d1b7b5e2ae54","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,54,35,172,55,101,154,189,230,241,121,57,56,197,209,183,181,226,174,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
