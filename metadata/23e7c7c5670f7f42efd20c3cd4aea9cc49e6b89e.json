The Ultimate Cut is exactly that, an enormous, ambitious film that is, by any standard, a classic. It's not perfect in the slightest, but what it lacks in narrative it makes up in big brass balls. The pacing is often erratic, but then again, so was the original novel, and the small cinematic conceits of pacing and re-ordering of the narrative are for the benefit of the film.\n\nWhat's different? Most of Black Freighter is integrated back in, alongside some touching dialogue between the two Bernards that turns their previous cinematic incarnation - as two extras - into a symbolically important, wider universe.\n\nThe Black Freighter exists in two or three minute increments spread out through the film as a whole. However, the jarring change in visual style - from the rough animation to a pristine CGI-fest - can pull the viewer out of the cinematic trance despite the richness of the parable running in parallel with the main narrative. Overall, as per The Directors Cut, many scenes are expanded with extra dialogue and nuance. And everything feels just a little bit more real.\n\nZack Snyder nails WATCHMEN. He gets it; the story, the genre, the history of the medium and the time in which it was told, and most importantly the subversive nature of Alan Moore and Dave GibbonsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ seminal comic. There were some changes that obviously needed to be made, but Snyder and Alex TseÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s adaptation definitely feels like the Watchmen universe come to life. ThereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a sense of background and history to the world that comes through (just look at the incredible opening credits sequence), and is greatly aided by some amazing set design and special effects. ThereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the awe of a real-life Dr. Manhattan or the amazement at witnessing the Owlship roar to life, but seeing little things like the street corner where the two Bernies hang out come so faithfully to life was definitely surreal, and luckily the film has the story to back up the great visuals on screen. Snyder also makes some great musical choices that give the film a pop culture sensibility and places it nicely within appropriate eras of society. Others, like the choice of Leonard CohenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHallelujahÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ during the Nite Owl-Silk Spectre sex scene, are inspired to say the least. \n\nDirector:Zack Snyder\n\nCast  (Cast overview, first billed only)\n\nMalin Akerman ...
