This is a set of exercises that uses a suspension trainer, but otherwise requires no extra equipment or gym facilities (everything can be done on a playground or park). This is a great way to get outside and enjoy the nice weather while you get in shape.\n\nThe exercises are explained and demonstrated to make sure you are doing them correctly. If you like this video, check out my other uploads to add more exercises to this kind of workout.\n\n\nVideo: MPEG4 Video (H264) 854x480 (137:77) 29.97fps 4934kbps\nAudio: AAC\nDuration: 22:21","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d81b48a30ef535d6b03216dd8bbe78215fee47aa","amp;dn":"CPA+Workout+II","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d81b48a30ef535d6b03216dd8bbe78215fee47aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,27,72,163,14,245,53,214,176,50,22,221,139,190,120,33,95,238,71,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
