From thunderous bombings at his own doorstep and the constant threat of Luftwaffe air raids to the landing of a German paratrooper in his neighborhood and the joyous obliteration of his much-hated school, Billy&amp;#039;s young life is shaped - and even enriched - by the one positive thing war has brought him: liberation from the ordinary.  And though Billy is surrounded by decimation and the smoking remnants of ruined lives, his sense of enchanted wonderment and innocence in the face of man&amp;#039;s most destructive folly affect him in a way that alters his life forever.\n\n\nGeneral #0\nComplete name        : Hope and Glory.avi\nFormat               : AVI\nFormat/Info          : Audio Video Interleave\nFormat/Family        : RIFF\nFile size            : 1.37 GiB\nPlayTime             : 1h 52mn\nBit rate             : 1732 Kbps\nWriting application  : VirtualDubMod 1.5.4.1 (build 2178/release)\nWriting library      : VirtualDubMod build 2178/release\nIAS1                 : English\n\nVideo #0\nCodec                : XviD\nCodec/Family         : MPEG-4\nCodec/Info           : XviD project\nCodec settings/Packe : Yes\nCodec settings/BVOP  : Yes\nCodec settings/QPel  : No\nCodec settings/GMC   : 0\nCodec settings/Matri : Default\nPlayTime             : 1h 52mn\nBit rate             : 1527 Kbps\nWidth                : 672 pixels\nHeight               : 368 pixels\nAspect ratio         : 16/9\nFrame rate           : 23.976 fps\nResolution           : 8 bits\nChroma               : 4:2:0\nInterlacement        : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)   : 0.258\nWriting library      : XviD 1.2.-127 (dev)\n\nAudio #0\nCodec                : AC3\nCodec profile        : Dolby Digital\nPlayTime             : 1h 52mn\nBit rate             : 192 Kbps\nBit rate mode        : CBR\nChannel(s)           : 2 channels\nChannel positions    : L R\nSampling rate        : 48 KHz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea42c6073c847b4aaba5048bd2a5efebe42bbb50","amp;dn":"Hope+and+Glory","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea42c6073c847b4aaba5048bd2a5efebe42bbb50","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,66,198,7,60,132,123,74,171,165,4,139,210,165,239,235,228,43,187,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
