They appeared on a joint billing with Heatwave, but the warm-up unbelievably was Geno Washington &amp; The Ram Jam Band...........What a line-up!\r\n\r\nThe majority are Vinyl Rips, simply entitled &quot;side 1&quot; or &quot;side 2&quot;, but all come with the relevant Art Work (covers) for both front &amp; back.\r\n\r\nEach side of an Album is therefore a single continuous track, as it would be if you listened to the original. If you don't like your music this way, then obviously you can use a file splitter and divide each &quot;side&quot; into several tracks, but I prefer to listen to my recordings as they were!\r\n\r\nThey were recorded at 192bps, which is the highest bit rate my Denon Turntable would allow.\r\n\r\nHaven't seen any torrents for most Tavares Albums in the years that I have been looking (this is my first upload), so I hope you enjoy these?\r\n\r\nAnthology (2004)\r\nCheck It Out (1974)\r\nFuture Bound (1978)\r\nGreatest Hits (2000)\r\nHard Core Poetry (1974\r\nIn The City (1975)\r\nLove Storm (1977)\r\nMadam Butterfly (1978)\r\nSky High! (1976)\r\nSupercharged (1980)\r\nThe Best of Tavares (1977)\r\n\r\nMy all time favourite Album from them is Sky High! When you listen, you'll soon know why","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:50280ce45e08cd43d7b03728f25eee2493db4fff","amp;dn":"Tavares+Discography","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"50280ce45e08cd43d7b03728f25eee2493db4fff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,40,12,228,94,8,205,67,215,176,55,40,242,94,238,36,147,219,79,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
