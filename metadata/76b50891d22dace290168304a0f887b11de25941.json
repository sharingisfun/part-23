The past-life memories of two women capture a true and compelling portrait of Jesus the man, from the healing miracles he performed to the gentle philosophy he preached. This is an INSIDER view, direct from Jesus' time, deep in feeling tones and profound in implications, giving a sense of how things truly were. This book includes drawings of the Temple and Old Jerusalem, and includes scenes at the Temple in Jerusalem, vists to homes and leper colonies, political intrigues leading to the crucifixion, and also the personal feelings of those who met him. The realism of this information is astounding.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:76b50891d22dace290168304a0f887b11de25941","amp;dn":"They+Walked+with+Jesus%3A+Past+Life+Experiences+with+Christ","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"76b50891d22dace290168304a0f887b11de25941","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,181,8,145,210,45,172,226,144,22,131,4,160,248,135,177,29,226,89,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
