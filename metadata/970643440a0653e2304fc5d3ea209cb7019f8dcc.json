Encouraged by his friend Bedil, he decides to pursue her. Najma thinks he is too forward and tries to punish him by putting salt in his food at her family's Eid celebration, but accidentally serves it to his father Dr. Khan instead. Najma then falls in love with Yusuf, meeting him secretly in the garden. Their romance is interrupted when Dr. Khan announces that he has betrothed his son to his cousin Raziya. Although Yusuf initially refuses to marry Raziya because she is an uneducated village girl and he loves Najma, Najma convinces him to marry Raziya to preserve his family's honor. Heartbroken, they both marry other people; Yusuf marries Raziya and Najma weds the wealthy Mukarram Nawab. Raziya finds out about Yusuf's hidden love and becomes very jealous. Meanwhile, Yusuf sinks into depression and Najma becomes ill with worry over him. Mukarram overhears Raziya jealously berating Najma over her love for Yusuf and resolves to kill him. But Mukarram has a serious accident and Yusuf is the only one who can save his life. Yusuf saves Mukarra's life and assures him and Raziya that he does not wish to take Najma away. Giving up each other forever, Yusuf and Najma part.\n\nNajma emphasises the importance of education and the necessity for modern development within the Muslim community, but also portrays the value of family honor and upholding traditions like arranged marriage. The film's upper class Lahknawi protagonists live in an economically privileged world and follow the traditional tehzeeb etiquette of Lucknow. The film mainly deals with family relationships and the effects of tehzeeb on them. Many of these elements became the prototype for later Muslim social films which usually focused on male-female relationships in upper-class Muslim communities\n\nYusuf is the son of a prominent and respected doctor in this community, and is himself studying medicine to become a doctor. One day he meets with beautiful Najma and both fall in love, and meet secretly. When his father announces that it is time for him to get married, Yusuf is delighted and would like to introduce Najma to his dad. But before he could even mention Najma, his father informs him that his marriage has been arranged with Raziya, an illiterate village belle. Yusuf refuses to marry Raziya, but his father convinces him to change his mind, and as a result the marriage takes place. But Yusuf is unable to get Najma out of his mind, and will have nothing to do with Raziya. Najma, on the other hand, realizes that fate has not intended them to marry, and has already consented to an arranged marriage by her family.\n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:-\nVideo Bitrate: 1295 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 640x480\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 29.970\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: Hindi\nRunTime: 1:55:17\nSubtitles: English\nRipped by: Trinidad [DDR]   \nDuration: 1:55:17\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:970643440a0653e2304fc5d3ea209cb7019f8dcc","amp;dn":"Najma+%281943%29+Xvid+1cd_Indian+Cinema-+The+Early+Years_Classic+%5BDD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"970643440a0653e2304fc5d3ea209cb7019f8dcc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,6,67,68,10,6,83,226,48,79,197,211,234,32,156,183,1,159,141,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
