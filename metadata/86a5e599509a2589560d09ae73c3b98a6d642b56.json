It enables to program, visualize, debug, run, and log Turing machine algorithms.\n \nKey Features\n \nThis is the list of key features that presents our visual Turing machine simulator as a good choice for studying and programming the Turing machine:\n \nConvenient creating of algorithms, ability to save and load them on/from a disk. \nFast adding of repetitive data onto the tape. \nVerification of correctness of an alrogithm and tape data. \nRunning and debugging in the three modes: normal, single-step, and a quick mode. \nLogging of programÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s execution, advanced output statistics. \nThe following sample programs are already included with the Turing machine simulator: mathematical addition, subtraction, division, multiplication, getting the square and the cube of a number (i.e. raising to the second and to the third power, respectively), binary counting, straight/flipped copy of text, and palindrome detection. \nDetailed help documentation is included. \nThe portable version of Uber Turing Machine is available. \nWorks on all Microsoft Windows operating systems, from Windows 95 and 98, through 2000 and XP, up to the newest Windows Vista and 7, including x64 editions. \n\nHomepage: http://www.superutils.com/products/uber-turing-machine/\n \nInstallation Instructions:\n \n1. Install Program.\n2. Use given serial to register application.\n3. Done, Enjoy.\n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:86a5e599509a2589560d09ae73c3b98a6d642b56","amp;dn":"SuperUtils+Uber+Turing+Machine+v1.4.16.109+with+Key+%5Biahq76%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"86a5e599509a2589560d09ae73c3b98a6d642b56","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,165,229,153,80,154,37,137,86,13,9,174,115,195,185,138,109,100,43,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
