It is a subject of fascination, not of understanding.&quot; This fascination began when ancient Greek travellers started visiting Egypt, and continues unto this day, more often than not as a scholarly search for the oldest roots of our cultural memory. Jan Assmann's superb academic achievement undoubtedly represents the single most significant contribution to the modern understanding of Ancient Egypt, reaching far beyond the boundaries of Egyptology proper. The essays in this volume, all written by his friends and disciples, reflect the tremendous impact of his oeuvre on the scholarly world, encompassing not only Egyptological and related themes, but also central aspects of Judaeo-Christian identity such as monotheism and the historical events surrounding the recently discovered Diaspora temple of Yahu on the island of Elephantine.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c739b27f5bb61e53749cb21eaa1a2eca63920149","amp;dn":"Egypt+-+Temple+of+the+Whole+World%3A+Studies+in+Honour+of+Jan+Assm","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c739b27f5bb61e53749cb21eaa1a2eca63920149","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,57,178,127,91,182,30,83,116,156,178,30,170,26,46,202,99,146,1,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
