(&quot;The Energy Never Dies&quot;), was released on June 9, 2009. The first single &quot;Boom Boom Pow&quot; was sent to U.S. radio on March 10, 2009 and was released on March 30, 2009 on iTunes. The single sold 465,000 downloads in its first week of digital release, the third-largest number of download sales in a single week overall, and the largest single-week and debut-download totals by a group in the history of digital-download sales tracking, reaching No. 1 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and Pop 100. It became the group's first U.S. No. 1, holding the spot for twelve consecutive weeks. It also reached number 1 in Australia, Canada, and the UK. The album has a more electro-hop beat rather than the usual hip hop/R&amp;B feeling of their previous albums. Three promotional singles, &quot;Imma Be&quot;, &quot;Alive&quot;, and &quot;Meet Me Halfway&quot;, were released through the iTunes Store in the three weeks running up to the album's release. In its first week, the album sold 304,000 copies and debuted at number 1 on the Billboard 200. In the United States, the album became the ninth album to top the one million mark in sales in 2009. The album has spent 38 weeks within the top 10 of the Billboard 200. The E.N.D. was the 7th best-selling album of 2009 in the U.S.. It also debuted at number one in Australia, number two in New Zealand and three in the United Kingdom.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a7334b7b4abee1f465fbabaa75476ba2642f2f8c","amp;dn":"Black+Eyed+Peas+-+The+Beginning+2010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a7334b7b4abee1f465fbabaa75476ba2642f2f8c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,51,75,123,74,190,225,244,101,251,171,170,117,71,107,162,100,47,47,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
