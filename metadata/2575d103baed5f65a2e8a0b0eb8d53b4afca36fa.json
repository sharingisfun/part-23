Old Shanghai was the uncontested Jazz capital of Asia, where musicians from the World over tested their musical mettle nightly to the delight of enthusiastic audiences.\n\nIn 1935, Du Yu Sheng, the notorious overlord of Shanghai's ominous &quot;Green Gang&quot; ordered into creation the first all-Chinese jazz group, called &quot;The Clear Wind Dance Band&quot;, to perform at the Yangtze River Hotel Dance Hall. Critics called this music Ã¢â‚¬Ëœpornographic,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ but the band played on just the same.\n\nThe wheels of time brought Shanghai's heady heyday to an end as the once-bustling nightclubs were boarded up or converted into Communist factory buildings, and Jazz music was outlawed as an 'indecent' form of entertainment...Until Now.\n\nThe Album:\n&quot;Shanghai Jazz: Musical Seductions from China's Age of Decadence&quot; features classics like Ã¢â‚¬Å“De Bu Dao De Ai QingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (The Love you CanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Get), delivered through the titillating gravel-voice of Ã¢â‚¬ËœGingerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Zheng ZhiXiao. Things get jumping with tunes like the riotous Ã¢â‚¬Å“Wo Yao Ni De AiÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (I Want Your Love)Ã¢â‚¬â€charged with life and humor by the confidently flamboyant Ã¢â‚¬ËœCocoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Zhao Ke, and closes with a bittersweet version of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Qing Ren de Yan LeiÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Lovers Tears) sung with heart-wrenching compassion by Ã¢â‚¬ËœCarrieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Zhang Le.\n\nIn total Ã¢â‚¬Å“Shanghai JazzÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ contains contributions from a cast of more than twenty talented young Chinese musicians, the leaders of an exciting jazz revival amidst the dramatic social and economic reform of the New Shanghai.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2575d103baed5f65a2e8a0b0eb8d53b4afca36fa","amp;dn":"Shanghai+Jazz%3A+Musical+Seductions+from+China%27s+Age+of+Decadence","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2575d103baed5f65a2e8a0b0eb8d53b4afca36fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,117,209,3,186,237,95,101,162,232,160,176,235,141,83,180,175,202,54,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
