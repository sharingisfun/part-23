It was released on September 17, 2002. Believe debuted at number 1 on the Billboard 200 chart, making it Disturbed's first number 1 debut, shipping over 284,000 copies in its first week. \n\nIt was certified double platinum by the RIAA in the United States on September 23, 2008.\n\nThe album contains three successful singles and focuses heavily on religious and spiritual themes inspired by recent tragedies. With greater emphases on melodic dynamics, it also demonstrates a broadening in Disturbed's musical range compared to the heavy onslaught of their debut album. \n\nBelieve was the last album to feature Steve &quot;Fuzz&quot; Kmak on bass, who was dismissed from the band in 2003.\n\nMP3 - 320kbs\n  \nNo. \t\t\n1. \t&quot;Prayer&quot;        \t3:41\n2. \t&quot;Liberate&quot;      \t3:30\n3. \t&quot;Awaken&quot;        \t4:29\n4. \t&quot;Believe&quot;         \t4:28\n5. \t&quot;Remember&quot;   \t        4:11\n6. \t&quot;Intoxication&quot;   \t3:14\n7. \t&quot;Rise&quot;          \t3:57\n8. \t&quot;Mistress&quot;       \t3:46\n9. \t&quot;Breathe&quot;        \t4:21\n10. \t&quot;Bound&quot;         \t3:53\n11. \t&quot;Devour&quot;         \t3:52\n12. \t&quot;Darkness&quot;       \t3:56\n\n13.     &quot;Remember (Live)&quot;        4:22\n14.     &quot;Bound (Live)&quot;           3:51\n15.     &quot;Fear (Live)&quot;            3:50\n16.     &quot;Conflict (Live)&quot;        4:40\n17.     &quot;Droppin' Plates (Live)&quot; 3:56\n18.     &quot;Shout 2000 (Live)&quot;      4:47\n\nPlease Dont Hit And Run !\n\nAnd Please Feel free to Comment, Reguest and tell me what you like :D","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc6cbb0e215144d0ca5bf75d09e3da8ab1090750","amp;dn":"Disturbed+-2002-+Believe+%28Australian+Tour+Limited+Edition%29%5B320kb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc6cbb0e215144d0ca5bf75d09e3da8ab1090750","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,108,187,14,33,81,68,208,202,91,247,93,9,227,218,138,177,9,7,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
