Great guitar throughout with a superb version of &quot;Tobacco Road&quot;, plus loads of originals. The band were involved with Steppenwolf's management and the sound is similar to the early years of that band as well as other heavy acid rock bands such as Yesterday's Children and Frantic. Great album and worth checking out.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:37edb02503a5c01a67dfbb53a17a60da28bed630","amp;dn":"Jamul+-+Jamul+%281970%29+%28VinylRip%29+%5BFLAC%5D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"37edb02503a5c01a67dfbb53a17a60da28bed630","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,237,176,37,3,165,192,26,103,223,187,83,161,122,96,218,40,190,214,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
