Weakened by their desires, these men turn to homosexual activities to satisfy their needs.

It portrays the events of the life of Saint Sebastian, including his iconic martyrdom by arrows. Most of the controversy surrounding the film derives from the homoeroticism portrayed between the soldiers. It is significant for being the first film to be entirely recorded accurately in Latin, which went as far as the translation of some dialogue into vulgar Latin.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b4a023e2ebbc3a20a5f5fa818d8a0be2ccec31c","amp;dn":"Sebastiane.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b4a023e2ebbc3a20a5f5fa818d8a0be2ccec31c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,74,2,62,46,187,195,162,10,95,95,168,24,216,160,190,44,206,195,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
