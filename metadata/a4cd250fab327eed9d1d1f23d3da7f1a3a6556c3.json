In 2003 the band made their first appearance\nat the Montreux Festival, despite having a long association with the town itself\n(they recorded there frequently in the seventies). It was a triumphant night and is\nregarded by both the band members and fans as probably the finest Yes gig ever\nto be filmed. It has been much in demand and is now finally cleared for release.\n\n\n\n# &quot;Siberian Khatru&quot;\nWritten by Jon Anderson, Steve Howe and Rick Wakeman\nPerformed by Yes\n\n\n# &quot;Magnification&quot;\nWritten by Jon Anderson, Steve Howe, Chris Squire and Alan White\nPerformed by Yes\n\n\n# &quot;Don't Kill The Whale&quot;\nWritten by Jon Anderson and Chris Squire\nPerformed by Yes\n\n\n# &quot;In The Presence Of&quot;\nWritten by Jon Anderson, Alan White, Steve Howe and Chris Squire\nPerformed by Yes\n\n\n# &quot;We Have Heaven&quot;\nWritten by Jon Anderson\nPerformed by Yes\n\n\n# &quot;South Side Of The Sky&quot;\nWritten by Jon Anderson, Chris Squire and Rick Wakeman\nPerformed by Yes\n\n\n# &quot;And You And I&quot;\nWritten by Jon Anderson, Steve Howe, Chris Squire and Bill Bruford\nPerformed by Yes\n\n\n# &quot;To Be Over&quot;\nArranged and Performed by Steve Howe\n\n\n# &quot;Clap&quot;\nWritten and Performed by Steve Howe\n\n\n# &quot;Show Me&quot;\nWritten by Jon Anderson\nPerformed by Jon Anderson with Wakeman\n\n\n# &quot;Catherine Of Aragon/ Anne Boleyn/ Jane Seymour&quot;\nWritten, Arranged and Performed by Rick Wakeman\n\n\n# &quot;Heart Of The Sunrise&quot;\nWritten by Jon Anderson, Chris Squire, Bill Bruford and Rick Wakeman\nPerformed by Yes\n\n\n# &quot;Long Distance Runaround&quot;\nWritten by Jon Anderson\nPerformed by Yes\n\n\n# &quot;The Fish&quot;\nWritten by Chris Squire\nArranged by Chris Squire and Alan White\nPerformed by Yes\nIncludes excerpts from 'Tempus Fugit' and 'On The Silent Wings Of Freedom'\n\n\n# &quot;Awaken&quot;\nWritten by Jon Anderson and Steve Howe\nPerformed by Yes\n\n\n# &quot;I've Seen All Good People&quot;\nWritten by Jon Anderson (a. &quot;Your Move&quot;) and Chris Squire (b. &quot;All Good People&quot;)\nPerformed by Yes\n\n\n# &quot;Roundabout&quot;\nWritten by Jon Anderson and Steve Howe\nPerformed by Yes\n\n\nFilming Locations:\nMontreux, Canton de Vaud, Switzerland\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://hiderefer.com/?http://img12.imageshack.us/img12/7064/snapshot1wa.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://hiderefer.com/?http://img12.imageshack.us/img12/7064/snapshot1wa.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://hiderefer.com/?http://img26.imageshack.us/img26/1774/snapshot2m.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://hiderefer.com/?http://img26.imageshack.us/img26/1774/snapshot2m.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://hiderefer.com/?http://img11.imageshack.us/img11/6159/snapshot3yc.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://hiderefer.com/?http://img11.imageshack.us/img11/6159/snapshot3yc.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://hiderefer.com/?http://img196.imageshack.us/img196/8616/snapshot4y.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://hiderefer.com/?http://img196.imageshack.us/img196/8616/snapshot4y.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nFile size                        : 4.00 GiB\nDuration                         : 2h 22mn\nOverall bit rate                 : 4016 Kbps\n\nWidth                            : 1920 pixels\nHeight                           : 1080 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 16/9\nFrame rate                       : 23.976 fps\n\nFormat                           : AC-3\nDuration                         : 2h 22mn\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 640 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 6 channels\nChannel positions                : Front: L C R, Surround: L R, LFE\nLanguage                         : English\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInfo Hash   A4CD250FAB327EED9D1D1F23D3DA7F1A3A6556C3","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4cd250fab327eed9d1d1f23d3da7f1a3a6556c3","amp;dn":"Yes+-+Live+at+montreux+2003-1080p%5BHDRip-Ac3Dolby-m2ts-PS3%5D%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4cd250fab327eed9d1d1f23d3da7f1a3a6556c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,205,37,15,171,50,126,237,157,29,31,35,211,218,127,26,58,101,86,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
