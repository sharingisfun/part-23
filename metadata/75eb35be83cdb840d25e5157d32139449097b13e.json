The group is just a solo project, though Walters employs a guitarist and drummer for the live shows. Ã¢â‚¬Å“I was tired of being in a band situation,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Walters says. Ã¢â‚¬Å“You know how it is having to answer to this person or that person. I just wanted to make music I wanted to hear. I do all the stuff myself. I play all the drums and do all the singing and play all the crap thatÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s on there. I do it all.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nMasked Men: When the bandÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s first album came out in 2003, Walters put a band together so that he could play live. Describing himself as a Ã¢â‚¬Å“lazy person,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ he put them in masks so that the group would have a Ã¢â‚¬Å“look or image but without it taking too long...I didnÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t want to rip off the Mentors but we decided to wear hoods.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nAround the World: The band has played in Chile, Germany and New Zealand. Ã¢â‚¬Å“I figured thatÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the best way to do things,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Walters says. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Playing in Cleveland, the whole thing wonÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t get you anywhere. The intention was to play the music and see where it goes. I wasnÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t trying to make it. I just wanted to make music I wanted to hear. Playing gigs was never the intent until the other guys forced me to play something live.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nBig in Dubai: The group recently caused a bit of controversy when it played a festival in Dubai. Ã¢â‚¬Å“People werenÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t ready for a real underground style of music,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Walters says. Ã¢â‚¬Å“TheyÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re still listening to Iron Maiden and Metallica and stuff like that.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Before the show, which was held in the lobby of a Holiday Inn, the band was given a set of rules to adhere to. The guys couldnÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t swear or interact with the audience in any way. They also werenÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t allowed to have drinks on stage. Ã¢â‚¬Å“People started getting rambunctious as we were playing,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Walters says. Ã¢â‚¬Å“The manager didnÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t know anything about us. He just saw us wearing these hoods and called the cops. The promoter came up and was pale as a ghost and told us to take off the hoods. He was shaky. ThatÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the thing. What are you going to do? YouÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re in Dubai. You can be like [comedian] Dave Chappelle and keep it real and get deported or decapitated. Or you can take the hood off. We did that and it was fine.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nWhy You Should Hear Them: The band issued a number of EPs before putting out a traditional LP in 2011. It was originally signed to the San Francisco label Nuclear War Now but has recently signed to Medina-based HellÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Head Bangers. With its guttural vocals and ragged guitars, a song like Ã¢â‚¬Å“Satanic RoyaltyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is simply menacing, suggesting the group is much heavier than Boulder. Walters says thatÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not necessarily the case. Ã¢â‚¬Å“That depends on your definition of heavy,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ he says. Ã¢â‚¬Å“This stuff to me is more straightforward and a Venom/Motorhead ripoff with my shitty playing. I donÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t know. ThatÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s where I was headed with it.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nYear: 2014\nCountry: United States\nGenre: Black/Speed Metal\nCodec: Mp3\nBitrate: 320Kbps\n\nTRACKLIST:\nDisc 1\n1.
