Their longevity can be attributed to a vibrant sound and the ability to inject humor into music. They don&amp;#039;t allow themselves to become mired in social issues as did the short-lived but often brilliant Cymande, whose LPs were essentially political statements. Osibisa&amp;#039;s only agenda is making good music, and if it happens to strike a political or social nerve, fine, but it&amp;#039;s not what they&amp;#039;re totally about. &quot;Wango Wango&quot; starts slow but evolves into a wicked jam that&amp;#039;s heavy as P-Funk. Pleasant flute and trumpet riffs accent the lovely &quot;So So MI La So.&quot; The bands&amp;#039; tribute to America, the floating &quot;Sweet America,&quot; teases and tantalizes. Percussion heads will appreciate &quot;Ye Tie Wo&quot; and &quot;Che Che Kule.&quot; The deepest slabs of social commentary are the thought-provoking &quot;Sweet Sounds&quot; and &quot;Did You Know.&quot; All tracks were written by all or various members of Osibisa, who share production credit with John Punter.
