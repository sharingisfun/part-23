After he is captured by the bandits, his shot-up stage is returned to the town by the gang in order to draw the authorities out of town. After being left for dead, Delong escapes to warn the townspeople of an imminent raid by the outlaws. They don't believe his story and, in fact, accuse him of complicity in the stage robbery, tasking the town's remaining deputy with arresting him. A besieged Delong hides out in a local saloon before making his next move.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3bac251b95fc9d3b26a45679c6adebab0da37541","amp;dn":"Riding+Shotgun++%28Western+1954%29++Randolph+Scott%2C+Wayne+Morris+%26am","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3bac251b95fc9d3b26a45679c6adebab0da37541","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,172,37,27,149,252,157,59,38,164,86,121,198,173,235,171,13,163,117,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
