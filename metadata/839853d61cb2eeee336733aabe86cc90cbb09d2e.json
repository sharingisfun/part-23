These are masterful performances which will please even those who don't yet know that they can enjoy period instrument performances. (In addition, this CD holds the maximum possible amount of nostalgic value for me; it was the first classical music compact disc-back when we called them that-that I ever listened to, as a teenager...sigh.) It was originally released by LÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Oiseau-Lyre in 1983. (And was the reason I became a lifelong Hogwood fan.)\n\nPlease enjoy, lovers of great music.\n\nMP3 @ 320","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:839853d61cb2eeee336733aabe86cc90cbb09d2e","amp;dn":"Haydn+-+Cello+Concertos+-+Hogwood%2C+AAM%2C+Coin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"839853d61cb2eeee336733aabe86cc90cbb09d2e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,152,83,214,28,178,238,238,51,103,51,170,190,134,204,144,203,176,157,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
