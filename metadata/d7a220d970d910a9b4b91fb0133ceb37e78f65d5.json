This the latest issue (2-24-2014) of Weekly Shonen Jump taken from the official site. I tried my best searching for officially translated manga through torrent sites so I can have actual backups, but no luck. So I decided to do this on my own.\n\nBasically I took a screenshot of every page and cropped out every unnecessary part in every image. I'll try to keep this up every week, but there's no guarantee since I have work most of the week. Weekly Shonen Jumps are released every Monday, so I'll try to have one up by the end of the week.\n\nIf there are any problems feel free to post it in the comments. I want to make sure there are no problems.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d7a220d970d910a9b4b91fb0133ceb37e78f65d5","amp;dn":"Weekly+Shonen+Jump+2%2F24%2F2014+%28Official+English%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d7a220d970d910a9b4b91fb0133ceb37e78f65d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,162,32,217,112,217,16,169,180,185,31,176,19,60,235,55,231,143,101,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
