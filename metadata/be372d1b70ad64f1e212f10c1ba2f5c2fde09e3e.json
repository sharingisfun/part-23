But compared to some of the gross misconduct in this frighteningly funny history book, well, let's just say he's in good company.

From illegitimate children (we thought Grover Cleveland was too boring to have sex) and illicit trysts (Warren G. Harding in the White House phone booth with his secretary) to turncoats (make up your own mind about Daniel Ellsberg) and traitors (General Wilkinson, aka a Spanish secret agent), you will discover all the dirt worth dishing since the founding of Jamestown.\n\nThe Book of BastardsÃ¢â‚¬â€because what you don't know about the history of our great nation can make you laugh and cry!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be372d1b70ad64f1e212f10c1ba2f5c2fde09e3e","amp;dn":"The+Book+of+Bastards+-+Brian+Thornton","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be372d1b70ad64f1e212f10c1ba2f5c2fde09e3e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,55,45,27,112,173,100,241,226,18,241,12,27,162,245,194,253,224,158,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
