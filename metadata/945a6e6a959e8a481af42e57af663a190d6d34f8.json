That's a tremendous load of one artist, but the legacy of Domino and his partner Dave Bartholomew is so consistently innovative and infectious that it never grows tiresome for a second. From the clarion call of &quot;The Fat Man,&quot; Domino's 1949 debut, to the storming &quot;Dance with Mr. Domino&quot; in 1962, he typified everything charming about Crescent City R&amp;B, his Creole patois and boogie-based piano a non-threatening vehicle for the rise of rock &amp; roll. ~ Bill Dahl, All Music Guide\n\n\nDisc Six:\n\n01.
