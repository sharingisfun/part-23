Nobody except me. I made some cuts myself. In the first version the film was 3 hours 20 minutes long. In the second ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ 3 hours 15 minutes. I shortened the final version to 3 hours 6 minutes. I am convinced the latest version is the best, the most successful. And I only cut certain overly long scenes. The viewer doesn't even notice their absence. The cuts have in no way changed neither the subject matter nor what was for us important in the film. In other words, we removed overly long scenes which had no significance.&quot;\nA. Tarkovski\n\n2.about the picture\nThe new Lizard edition has a very good image - perhaps the best I have seen. It is one DVD9 and one DVD5 and appears (from the screen captures) far superior to both the Criterion and RusCiCo. It again shows the cropping on the Criterion and that the CC edition has weak contrast. I was expecting to find Edge enhancement but it seems clean. It is sharper, brighter and the best contrast. Unfortunately this is the 'cut version' and is only in Russian with no English subtitles, but it is quite gratifying to know that another version could be available to us with such sterling quality. Colors are different, and may possibly be the most accurate. Its hard to know for sure, but they are more vibrant. If you are very familiar with the film, and want the &quot;cut version&quot; the Lizard print is the way to go... even if its just for the visuals. Let's hope this ignites a fire to get a strong print &quot;cut version&quot; for English language audiences soon.]\n\nWidely recognized as a masterpiece, Andrei Tarkovsky's 205-minute medieval epic, based on the life of the Russian monk and icon painter, was not seen as the director intended it until its re-release over twenty years after its completion. The film was not screened publicly in its own country (and then only in an abridged form) until 1972, three years after winning the International Critics Prize at the Cannes Film Festival. Calling the film frightening, obscure, and unhistorical, Soviet authorities edited the picture on several occasions, removing as much as an entire hour from the original.\n\nPresented as a tableaux of seven sections in black and white, with a final montage of Rublev's painted icons in color, the film takes an unflinching gaze at medieval Russia during the first quarter of the 15th century, a period of Mongol-Tartar invasion and growing Christian influence. Commissioned to paint the interior of the Vladimir cathedral, Andrei Rublev (Anatoli Solonitsyn) leaves the Andronnikov monastery with an entourage of monks and assistants, witnessing in his travels the degradations befalling his fellow Russians, including pillage, oppression from tyrants and Mongols, torture, rape, and plague. Faced with the brutalities of the world outside the religious enclave, Rublev's faith is shaken, prompting him to question the uses or even possibility of art in a degraded world. After Mongols sack the city of Vladimir, burning the very cathedral that he has been commissioned to paint, Rublev takes a vow of silence and withdraws completely, removing himself to the hermetic confines of the monastery.\n\nRising quickly out of this mire, the film's final section (a short story in its own right) concerns a boy named Boriska (Nikolai Burlyayev) who convinces a group of travelling bell-makers that his father passed on to him the secret of bell-making. The men take Boriska along, mostly because they pity and are amused by him, but they are quickly enthralled by the boy's ambition, determination, and confidence that he alone knows how to build the perfect bell. Boriska is soon commanding an army of assistants and peasant workers, and, indeed, his fierce temperament and refusal to accept anything but the best possible work and materials from the men fools the viewer -- possibly Boriska himself is fooled -- into thinking that he does in fact possess the secret, and that on the appointed day when the silver bell is lifted from the ground and its mallet set in place, it will ring. Amid this maelstrom of activity and confusion, Rublev appears; at first standoffish and mistrustful of the boy, he finds himself drawn to Boriska's courage and unselfconscious desire to create. Moved to put aside his vow of silence, Rublev serves finally as the boy's confessor, and he finds that, through Boriska, his faith, and art, have been renewed.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img522.imageshack.us/img522/6756/vlcsnapnaturemorterf0.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img522.imageshack.us/img522/6756/vlcsnapnaturemorterf0.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img260.imageshack.us/img260/6020/vlcsnap862727xl0.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img260.imageshack.us/img260/6020/vlcsnap862727xl0.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img119.imageshack.us/img119/2474/vlcsnapfondeurxi0.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img119.imageshack.us/img119/2474/vlcsnapfondeurxi0.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img61.imageshack.us/img61/7158/vlcsnap767989cc8.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img61.imageshack.us/img61/7158/vlcsnap767989cc8.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n---------not my rip--------\n\n~~~~~~ Dvdrip.Lizard.Andrei.Roublev.Tarkovski.Part1.avi ~~~~~~                                     \n                                                               \nFile Size (in bytes):...........................1,265,752,064                     \n                                                                                \n--- Video Information ---                                                       \nVideo Codec Name:...............................XviD ISO MPEG-4              \nDuration (hh:mm:ss):............................1:21:14                \nFrame Count:....................................121830             \nFrame Width (pixels):...........................672                  \nFrame Height (pixels):..........................288                  \nAspect Ratio:...................................2.333                     \nFrames Per Second:..............................25.000          \nVideo Bitrate (kbps):...........................1620                 \n......MPEG-4......B-VOP........................                    \nQuality Factor (bits/pixel)/frame:..............0.335&quot;                     \n                                                                                \n--- Audio Information ---                                                       \nAudio Codec:....................................0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3                   \nAudio Sample Rate (Hz):.........................48000             \nAudio Bitrate(kbps):............................448                 \nAudio Bitrate Type (&quot;CBR&quot; or &quot;VBR&quot;):............CBR            \nAudio Channel Count:............................6      \n\n*************************\n\n    Freakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
