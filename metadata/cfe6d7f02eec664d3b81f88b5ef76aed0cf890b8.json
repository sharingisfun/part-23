Other times, you have to fight for it.\n\nFor Ryan Moore, the choice to fight is like the choice to breathe--necessary. After being wounded in war and discharged from the United States Marine Corps, competitive MMA fighting is the only thing heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s still able to excel at. Every round is a risk he canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t afford to take, but time spent outside of the cage is purgatory, until he meets female fighter Ally Rivera. For the first time since an IED blast destroyed life as he knew it, he wants something--someone. And she wants him, but the lingering effects of war might just tear them apart, if the gang violence that plagues her family doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t kill them first.\n\nRough Around the Edges is RyanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s side of the love story told in Battered Not Broken. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not a sequel, but a separate novel written for those who want to experience the story through RyanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s eyes. Read Battered Not Broken first or simply dive right in and enjoy an erotic romance novel told completely from a male point of view.\n\n\nSeed and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cfe6d7f02eec664d3b81f88b5ef76aed0cf890b8","amp;dn":"Rough+Around+the+Edges+by+Ranae+Rose+%5BMU%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cfe6d7f02eec664d3b81f88b5ef76aed0cf890b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,230,215,240,46,236,102,77,59,129,248,139,94,247,106,237,12,248,144,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
