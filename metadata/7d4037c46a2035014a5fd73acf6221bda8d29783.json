It is full of quick, simple and great-tasting recipes for people with chronic kidney disease (CKD), along with their friends and families. Our focus is on healthy eating and why this is so important in preventing and treating CKD. We want to show people living with CKD that eating for health can be an easy and effective way to improve their chances of living long and active lives. The book is divided into two sections. The first gives some factual information about food and nutrition in relation to kidney disease. The second includes over 50 delicious recipes to show you that eating can still be pleasurable.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d4037c46a2035014a5fd73acf6221bda8d29783","amp;dn":"Eating+Well+for+Kidney+Health+%28Class+Health%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d4037c46a2035014a5fd73acf6221bda8d29783","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,64,55,196,106,32,53,1,74,95,215,58,207,98,33,189,168,210,151,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
