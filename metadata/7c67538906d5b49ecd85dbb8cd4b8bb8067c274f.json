His comments caused a storm of controversy, and Watson was condemned.\n\nMeanwhile, right-wing websites hailed him as the new Galileo: a martyr to political correctness, which was concealing the fact that there is indeed evidence that shows different races score differently in IQ tests.\n\nBut are the tests biased? Is race really a scientific category at all? In this documentary, Rageh Omaar sets out to find out the truth, meeting scientists who believe the research supports the view that races can be differentiated as well as those who vehemently oppose this view.\n\nBy daring to ask the difficult questions, Omaar is able to explode the myths about race and IQ and reveal what he thinks are important lessons for society.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.channel4.com/programmes/race-and-intelligence-sciences-last-taboo/articles/category/features&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.channel4.com/programmes/race-and-intelligence-sciences-last-taboo/articles/category/features&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nSource: http://www.thebox.bz/details.php?id=96771\nCap: evil-koala\nOther shunster posts","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c67538906d5b49ecd85dbb8cd4b8bb8067c274f","amp;dn":"Race+and+Intelligence%3A+Science%5C%27s+Last+Taboo+2009+10+26+Ch+4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c67538906d5b49ecd85dbb8cd4b8bb8067c274f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,103,83,137,6,213,180,158,205,133,219,184,205,75,139,184,6,124,39,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
