She has been singing ever since. Now a sophomore in high school, Lindsey has one of those special voices that combines a beautiful timbre, a natural vibrato, and a radiant purity. Her first album of Christmas music, &quot;Glory to the New Born King&quot; contains a collection of traditional Christmas carols, performed the way they were meant to be, with beauty and reverence.
