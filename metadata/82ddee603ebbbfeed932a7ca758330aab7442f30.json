In this brand new series, chef Jock Zonfrillo celebrates the world's native cuisines and saves a treasure trove of gastronomic knowledge from extinction.\n\nPacking nothing but a knife roll and a sense of adventure, Jock will embark on a journey to some of the most remote communities on the planet. Persuading the locals to share their unique knowledge of food with him, Jock will hunt, forage, harvest and cook with everyone from Amazonian Indians to Ethiopian highlanders. He then pays homage to their culinary know-how and culture by reinterpreting the most inspiring elements back at his restaurant in Adelaide.
