Myths are proved true, probable, possible, improbable or busted. Often after the real-world practical tests have proved or debunked a Myth, the team will take the experiment to the extreme, many times using more modern technology than the myth could have used or upping the black powder for impressive explosions.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:001b47383ac2e490907c560565f4d93a64d45209","amp;dn":"MythBusters.S12E05.HDTV.x264-KILLERS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"001b47383ac2e490907c560565f4d93a64d45209","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,27,71,56,58,194,228,144,144,124,86,5,101,244,217,58,100,212,82,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
