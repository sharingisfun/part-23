Perhaps this will help\nsolve the rare boot-install error.\n-Note that this boot install error is very rare and only seems to occur\nin x64 versions. You might want to follow the x64 comments and see if\npeople report that it fixes their issues.\n-If the x64 people say it works better, you might want to use it anyway\nif you don't mind re-downloading.\n-There is a weird connection with dism and file attributes and properties.\nIt's hard to explain, but during my early testing with winre stuff, I\nnoticed that improper file attributes would make a mount folder unable to\nunmount. It could be as simple as not deleting files that were previously\ndifferently attributed, or it could be indicative of a larger problem.\n\nCredits:\nCODYQX4 - AutoKMS Activator from MTK 2.5.1\nmurphy78 - Testing, ISO design, Integration, Diskpart/Apply script\n\nEnjoy Pirates,\nmurphy78-TPB/MDL :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e0f4893d4afd72a186e7a82cf84b186910c0a40","amp;dn":"Windows+8.1+AIO+24in1+with+Update+x86+v2+en-US+Jun2014","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e0f4893d4afd72a186e7a82cf84b186910c0a40","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,15,72,147,212,175,215,42,24,110,122,130,207,132,177,134,145,12,10,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
