One is knit only, the other is crochet only [which also \n\nincludes lots of baby afghans and blankets], and another one is of books/booklets/magazines which have both knit and crochet patterns, thus couldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“t be separated. \nThey have been painstakingly collected from all over the web, sorted, page numbers corrected where needed, duplicates pruned, renamed for consistency, putting author name where available, or publisher, often adding sizes or years of children involved.I separated the patterns into babies (0-2 years) and children, for ease of browsing. \nAdditionally, in many cases of really bad scans (dark, crooked, barrelled/warped, faded, fuzzy, colours blueish, blotched, including extraneous background etc...), extensively edited with Photoshop to become both presentable and easier to use. The torrent is not in .rar, so you can pick and choose, but if you already have one of those files, I strongly recommend that you compare file size to see if itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“s really the same. If it was a bad scan, chances are that I have edited it, so this version will be much clearer and more readable. After all, in knitting patterns, readability is even more important than in books - every little word or number counts, and we donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“t want to ruin our eyes, do we? I have also included a picture of a handy chart I made with child sizes by age and chest in cm and inches, so that you can immediately see which patterns are suitable for the child you have in mind. Presented with all my love to all knitters all over the world. I hope you enjoy these collections!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:990368ab380a933e7cf21042760c07a5a8db0390","amp;dn":"Knitting+patterns+-+babies+and+children+%28mega+collection%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"990368ab380a933e7cf21042760c07a5a8db0390","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,3,104,171,56,10,147,62,124,242,16,66,118,12,7,165,168,219,3,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
