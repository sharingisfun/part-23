Many of\nThe BahamasÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ thousands of miles of perfect coral sand beaches remain\nfree of footprints.\nCharting its own course from Britain since 1973, the archipelago is made\nup of a landmass of 700 islands. The prospect of deciding which island is\nright for you isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t as daunting as that figure suggests. Most of the islands Ã¢â‚¬â€\nor islets, in some cases Ã¢â‚¬â€ arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t inhabited. Of those islands that are\ninhabited, only a few are graced with places to stay.\nDonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t come here looking for mountainous interiors like the ones found in\nJamaica or Puerto Rico. Instead of hills, The Bahamas offer seascapes that\nseem to stretch forever. For the most part, beaches of white, golden, or,\nin some rare cases, pink sands ring the islands. If youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re flying over them\nlike a bird, you can see translucent waters shimmering in the sunlight Ã¢â‚¬â€\npale aquamarine, blue sapphire, or what an aerial photographer once\ncalled Ã¢â‚¬Å“dancing green.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nEntire books containing only photographs of these swirling water patterns\nhave been published. As more and more of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s seas\nbecome polluted, the Bahamian waters alone make this island nation\nworth a trip.\nIn Bahamas For Dummies, 4th Edition, we help you discover the islands,\nfocusing on the high points but also warning you about some of the low\npoints. Of course, we hit all the hot spots, like the well-touristed Nassau,\nParadise Island, and Freeport/Lucaya on Grand Bahama Island. But we\nalso take you to the less-visited and harder-to-reach islands, such as the\nExumas in the southern Bahamas, perfect for those visitors seeking an\nescape for some serious R &amp; R","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:310ddbad4c831b5b630e228f7c0a64f59cfe5046","amp;dn":"Bahamas.For.Dummies","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"310ddbad4c831b5b630e228f7c0a64f59cfe5046","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,13,219,173,76,131,27,91,99,14,34,143,124,10,100,245,156,254,80,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
