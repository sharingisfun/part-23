Set in the New York City borough of The Bronx, the show starred Ted Danson as the title character, Dr. John Becker, a doctor who operates a small practice and is constantly annoyed by his patients, co-workers, friends, and practically everything and everybody else in his world. As a result of his outspoken nature, Becker is inaccessible to most people that do not know him. His patients and friends are nonetheless loyal, because Becker portrays a kind-hearted side that shows that, despite his cantankerous personality, he really does care about them.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6294e0ff9c566fd72698ffddabbad9628d0c1079","amp;dn":"Becker.S02.DVDRip.XviD-FFNDVD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6294e0ff9c566fd72698ffddabbad9628d0c1079","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,148,224,255,156,86,111,215,38,152,255,221,171,186,217,98,141,12,16,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
