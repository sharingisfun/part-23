She went to live with her mother after her parents divorce, living in poverty. Marie herself would be married three times, all ending in divorce. But she was still determined to give her children what she was missing as a kid. Despite her problems finding love for herself, she became a successful matchmaker for a wealthy socialite, and has appeared on 60 minutes. Then Marie met and married husband number four. But he was an addict and an alcoholic, a fate she soon would meet up with. Her husband has since died from his alcoholism and she is headed down the same path, unless an intervention takes place.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ceaca2987291d9b30f27deed2ba7a3bee642ce47","amp;dn":"intervention.s05e05.Marie.hdtv-0tv.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ceaca2987291d9b30f27deed2ba7a3bee642ce47","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,172,162,152,114,145,217,179,15,39,222,237,43,167,163,190,230,66,206,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
