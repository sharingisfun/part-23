O'Gorman\n\nEnglish | 2012 | ISBN: 0819571458 | 136 pages | PDF | 5,2 MB\n\nGervase Wheeler was an English-born architect who designed such important American works as the Henry Boody House in Brunswick, Maine; the Patrick Barry House in Rochester, New York; and the chapels at Bowdoin and Williams colleges. But he was perhaps best known as the author of two influential architecture books, Rural Homes (1851) and Homes for the People (1855). \n\nYet Wheeler has remained a little known, enigmatic figure. RenÃƒÂ©e Tribert and James F. OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢GormanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s study sheds new light on the course of WheelerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s career in the states, and brings crucial issues to the foreÃ¢â‚¬â€the international movement of ideas, the development of the American architectural profession, the influence of architectural publications on popular taste, and social history as expressed in the changing nature of the American house. WheelerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s career is traced chronologically and geographically and the book is lavishly illustrated with over fifty images, including building plans and historical photographs","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d31736b7747452a9a38434a7e1c0d1776b1d8f5c","amp;dn":"Gervase+Wheeler+-+A+British+Architect+in+America%2C+1847-1860","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d31736b7747452a9a38434a7e1c0d1776b1d8f5c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,23,54,183,116,116,82,169,163,132,52,167,225,192,209,119,107,29,143,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
