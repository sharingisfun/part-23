This collection, edited by the creator and executive producer of the show, offers supreme insight into the class struggles and love stories of the series. Essays by top writers intelligently address a multitude of questions, such as Is Veronica a modern-day vigilante? Why is a show that features rape, potential incest, and a teen girl outsmarting local authorities so popular with AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s conservative population? and Why is Veronica and LoganÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s relationship the most important story-driving factor in the show?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:efbcc78bee67cf03fb2f6358bd8559dad2b3d05d","amp;dn":"Neptune+Noir%3A+Unauthorized+Investigations+into+Veronica+Mars","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"efbcc78bee67cf03fb2f6358bd8559dad2b3d05d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,188,199,139,238,103,207,3,251,47,99,88,189,133,89,218,210,179,208,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
