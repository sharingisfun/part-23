Although he received critical acclaim for much of his work, he became best known for the runaway success of a rendition of his song Kinders van die Wind by Laurika Rauch.\n\nKoos du Plessis was born in Rustenburg. He was the youngest of four children, and grew up in the mining town of Springs. After school, he attended the University of Pretoria, and the University of the Witwatersrand, majoring in Afrikaans-Nederlands (Afrikaans-Dutch). At university he met his future wife, Mornay. The couple had three daughters, Irma, Karien and Karla. Koos would eventually write a song for each of these four women in his life.\n\nKoos worked as journalist and editor for several Afrikaans publications (Oggendblad, Die Vaderland, Die Nataller en Die Transvaler). He died in a car accident close to Krugersdorp during the early morning hours of 15 January 1984. \n\n\n\nALBUMS:\n\nDIE VIERDE HORISON\nHERBERGIER\nSKADU'S TEEN DIE MURE\nAS ALMAL VER IS\n\nALL TRACKS IN MP3 FORMAT, 256 kbps\n\nSCANNED WITH ESET SMART SECURITY: NO THREATS OR INFECTIONS\n\nPLEASE SEED !!\n\nENJOY!!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4b6e9530ed523c98fa777b87a9c1693b0c72cc6","amp;dn":"Koos+du+Plessis++++-++++4+Albums","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4b6e9530ed523c98fa777b87a9c1693b0c72cc6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,182,233,83,14,213,35,201,143,167,119,184,122,156,22,147,176,199,44,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
