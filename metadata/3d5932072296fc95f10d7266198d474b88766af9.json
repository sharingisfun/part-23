It was originally aired on MTV. The tour featured arguably the most varied setlist Kiss has ever played, featuring songs from seven of the band's studio releases up to that point. Three songs from Animalize were played, and many of the band's more popular songs were performed. The show was filmed on the same day temporary guitarist Bruce Kulick was named an official member, replacing Mark St. John. As suggested by its title, Animalize Live Uncensored features plenty of filthy on-stage banter from singer/guitarist Paul Stanley.\n\nThe biggest criticism's with the VHS/LaserDisc release was their heavy studio overdubbing. Much of Paul Stanley's guitar playing was re-recorded in the studio prior to the final audio mix for the video release, just like what was done with Alive and Alive II.[citation needed] Stanley's vocals were heavily, if not entirely, overdubbed in the studio to make for a cleaner audio presentation.[citation needed] The concert has yet to be officially released on DVD. The only DVD version available is a Brazilian-produced bootleg ripped from a Japanese laserdisc.[1] The concert is reportedly set to be re-released as part of the upcoming fourth volume in the band's Kissology series.\n\n\n\nNo. \tTitle \tWriter(s) \tLength 90 minutes\n\t\n1. \t&quot;Detroit Rock City&quot;   \tPaul Stanley, Bob Ezrin \t \n2. \t&quot;Cold Gin&quot;   \tAce Frehley \t \n3. \t&quot;Creatures of the Night&quot;   \tStanley, Adam Mitchell \t \n4. \t&quot;Fits Like a Glove&quot;   \tGene Simmons \t \n5. \t&quot;Heaven's on Fire&quot;   \tStanley, Desmond Child \t \n6. \t&quot;Thrills in the Night&quot;   \tStanley, Jean Beauvoir \t \n7. \t&quot;Paul StanleyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s guitar solo&quot;   \t  \t \n8. \t&quot;Under the Gun&quot;   \tStanley, Eric Carr, Child \t \n9. \t&quot;War Machine&quot;   \tSimmons, Bryan Adams, Jim Vallance \t \n10. \t&quot;Eric CarrÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s drum solo&quot;   \t  \t \n11. \t&quot;Young and Wasted&quot;   \tSimmons, Vinnie Vincent \t \n12. \t&quot;Gene SimmonsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ bass solo&quot;   \t  \t \n13. \t&quot;I Love It Loud&quot;   \tSimmons, Vincent \t \n14. \t&quot;I Still Love You&quot;   \tStanley, Vincent \t \n15. \t&quot;Love Gun&quot;   \tStanley \t \n16. \t&quot;Lick It Up&quot;   \tStanley, Vincent \t \n17. \t&quot;Black Diamond&quot;   \tStanley \t \n18. \t&quot;Rock and Roll All Nite&quot;   \tStanley, Simmons \t \n\n\n    Paul Stanley- rhythm guitar, lead vocals\n    Gene Simmons- bass guitar, lead vocals\n    Eric Carr- drums, backing vocals, lead vocals on &quot;Young and Wasted&quot; and &quot;Black Diamond&quot;\n    Bruce Kulick- lead guitar; backing vocals on &quot;I Love It Loud&quot;\n\nOUT OF PRINT...SEED SEED SEED TILL YOU BLEED FUCKERZ!!!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d5932072296fc95f10d7266198d474b88766af9","amp;dn":"Kiss+-+Animalize+Live+Uncensored+Home+Video+1984+%28Out+Of+Print%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d5932072296fc95f10d7266198d474b88766af9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,89,50,7,34,150,252,149,241,13,114,102,25,141,71,75,136,118,106,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
