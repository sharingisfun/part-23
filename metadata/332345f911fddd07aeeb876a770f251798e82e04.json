He finds himself flying the lone Christmas day mission over war-torn Bosnia. But when he talks pilot Stackhouse into flying slightly off-course to check out an interesting target, the two get shot down. Burnett is soon alone, trying to outrun a pursuing army, while commanding officer Reigert finds his rescue operation hamstrung by politics, forcing Burnett to run far out of his way.\n\nIMDB: http://imdb.com/title/tt0159273/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:332345f911fddd07aeeb876a770f251798e82e04","amp;dn":"Behind+Enemy+Lines%5B2001%5DDVDrip%5BENG%5D-PZE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"332345f911fddd07aeeb876a770f251798e82e04","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,35,69,249,17,253,221,7,174,235,135,106,119,15,37,23,152,232,46,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
