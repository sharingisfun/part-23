The game is a puzzle/adventure game hybrid, where the player learns\nabout the characters and world of Wayward Manor through observation\ndiscovery, and puzzle solving. The game was first revealed on the website\nWhoHauntsNeil.com, and has been slowly unveiling its story and world to a\nwhole new audience. Wayward Manor is Neil Gaiman's first foray into video\ngames\n\nWayward Manor invites you to jump into the afterlife of a disgruntled\nghost, trying to reclaim his house from its newfound owners. Set in the\n1920s, this puzzle/adventure game transports players to an era of dark\nscrewball comedy where they must unlock the secrets of a twisted mansion\nPlayers will discover the quirks of Wayward Manor's unwelcome guests and\nchoose how to prey on their darkest fears\n\nThe Budds, a dysfunctional family of misfits and eccentrics, have brought\ntheir own abysmal possessions into your humble abode and stifled your\npower. Each level is a playground for scares where players earn fear to\ntake back control of the room.
