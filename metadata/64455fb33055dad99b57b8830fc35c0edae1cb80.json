No one except Niquette Delongpre, the survivor who ran away from the mangled stretch of guardrail on Highway 22 where the impossible occurredÃ¢â‚¬Â¦and kept on running. Who left behind her best friends, Ben and Anthem, to save them from her newfound capacity for destructionÃ¢â‚¬Â¦and who alone knows the source of her very bizarreÃ¢â‚¬â€and very deadlyÃ¢â‚¬â€abilities: an isolated strip of swampland called Elysium.\n\nAn accomplished surgeon, NiquetteÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s father dreamed of transforming the dense acreage surrounded by murky waters into a palatial compound befitting the name his beloved wife gave to it, Elysium: Ã¢â‚¬Å“the final resting place for the heroic and virtuous.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Then, ten years ago, construction workers dug into a long-hidden well, one that snaked down into the deep, black waters of the Louisiana swamp and stirred something that had been there for centuriesÃ¢â‚¬â€a microscopic parasite that perverts the mind and corrupts the body.\n\nNiquette is living proof that things done canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be undone. Nothing will put her family back together again. And nothing can save her. But as Niquette, Ben, and Anthem uncover the truth of a devastating parasite that has the potential to alter the future of humankind, Niquette grasps the most chilling truths of all: someone else has been infected too. And unlike her, this man is not content to live in the shadows. He is intent to use his newfound powers for one reason only: revenge.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:64455fb33055dad99b57b8830fc35c0edae1cb80","amp;dn":"The+Heavens+Rise+-+Christopher+Rice","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"64455fb33055dad99b57b8830fc35c0edae1cb80","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,69,95,179,48,85,218,217,155,87,184,131,15,195,92,14,218,225,203,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
