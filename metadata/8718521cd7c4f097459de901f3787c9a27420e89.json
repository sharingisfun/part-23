Rampling plays the titular character, who may hold the key to a murder investigation being conducted by Byrne's insomniac detective, as she was at the apartment of the victim on the night of his death. Anna's perspective on the crime makes us doubt the truth of what we see, which makes for a compelling psychological mystery.
