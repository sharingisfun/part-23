One cannot imagine needing another recording of these works. The Opp. 2 and 5 Trio Sonatas are here performed by Pavlo Beznosiuk and Rodolfo Richter (violins), Rachel Brown (flute and recorder), Joseph Crouch (cello), and Richard Egarr (harpsichord). The recording was released by Harmonia Mundi in 2009.\n\nPlease enjoy.\n\nMP3 @ 320","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b77f5d63d2646350264a021b2f8d25bd97385a61","amp;dn":"Handel+-+Trio+Sonatas%2C+Op.+2+and+Op.+5+-+Egarr%2C+AAM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b77f5d63d2646350264a021b2f8d25bd97385a61","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,127,93,99,210,100,99,80,38,74,2,27,47,141,37,189,151,56,90,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
