The music many of us grew up with in the late 90Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s and early 00Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s. I thought, Ã¢â‚¬Å“ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d be really cool if someone did this in the highest qualityÃ¢â‚¬Â¦and rightÃ¢â‚¬Â¦for the *entire movie*. That would be so freaking cool, especially for us fans that grew up with that dub.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ So, I did. And then some.\n\nBefore I say anything else, I want to make it clear: I am a fan of both scores, both dubs, Japanese and English, the showÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s original Japanese score, the showÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s FUNimation produced score, the movieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s original score, everything. This is NOT meant to start another war in the comments about which score or soundtrack is better. I did this as a fun project because thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s always demand (nostalgia-driven, yes) from a lot of people who grew up with this music while experiencing the series for the first time on Cartoon NetworkÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Toonami block or the subsequent DVD releases. I didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t do this in spite of the original score or in disregard for it; I did it so that all of us that grew up with this style of Dragon Ball Z can re-experience it again through this movie with *another version* of BoG. A re-scored version that caters to American (and even global) fans of Dragon Ball Z that started watching it when Cartoon NetworkÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Toonami block was first airing FUNimationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s original dub of the series, when the Dragon Ball Z and anime phenomenon spread in America.\n\nThere are fun bits I added for the all-around Dragon Ball fan, this isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t just a Faulconer Productions editionÃ¢â‚¬Â¦it Ã¢â‚¬Å“isÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s slightly more than that. If youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re even more *Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½classic old-school dubÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½* youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be pleased to see that I added the *true original dubÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s*, the Ocean DubÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s, theme song: &quot;Main Title&quot; &amp; &quot;End Title&quot;Ã¢â‚¬Â¦better known as &quot;Rock the Dragon&quot; into this edit (because nothing screams DBZ nostalgia for me, and probably you, like hearing Ã¢â‚¬Å“Rock the DragonÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½). I also paid homage to the original Japanese score with &quot;Makafushigi Adventure!&quot; in a bright and funny way throughout the movie. And once again if you love the original Japanese score -and honestly if youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re a Dragon Ball fan in general-, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re going to love the credits, I had fun with what I inserted in there (it syncs up perfectly with the end).\n\nSo please, sit down and watch, enjoy and share. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve put many hours and nights into this, play it loud! If you have headphones and like to watch with those, please do and blast it! If the response for this goes well and thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s demand I might consider making a Ã¢â‚¬ËœCZ EditionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ (aka Faulconer Productions soundtrack/score edit) for *Resurrection Ã¢â‚¬ËœFÃ¢â‚¬â„¢* and eventually even the new series *Dragon Ball Super*. Speaking of, HOW CRAZY IS IT THAT WEÃ¢â‚¬â„¢RE GETTING NEW MOVIES AND A NEW SERIES OF DRAGON BALL IN 2015 GUYS?! ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s pretty crazy.&quot;\n\nCheck the .nfo file for more Information, FAQ &amp; Fun Facts!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:719b5e370d745cc333a444b1078220a60ce2fe06","amp;dn":"Dragon+Ball+Z%3A+Battle+of+Gods+%28CZ+Edition%29+-Bruce+Faulconer+Edit","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"719b5e370d745cc333a444b1078220a60ce2fe06","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,155,94,55,13,116,92,195,51,164,68,177,7,130,32,166,12,226,254,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
