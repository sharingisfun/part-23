The story starts in Republican Spain, with the extraordinary progress of Caridad Mercader, one time bourgeois housewife and then bohemian radical and KGB organiser. It was her son Ramon who plunged the ice pick into Trotsky's skull in Mexico. If there is a general absence of individual psychological analysis, it is chiefly because many of the lives examined are explained so much more effectively by 'history' and the times. That said, intriguing archive footage of Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera, impressive talking heads including Trotsky's security guards, and powerful sidebars make for steadily fascinating viewing.\n\nFrom DVDtalk:\n\nLess than a month ago Savant reviewed Joseph Losey's The Assassination of Trotsky, filling in that feature's lack of background on its own subject with factual tidbits from the Internet. Now comes Facets Video's impressive Storm the Skies, an absorbing account of the life of the mystery assassin known as Frank Jacson, told by people who knew his family or who even met him personally. The docu starts with the life of RamÃƒÂ³n Mercader but ends up representing the viewpoint of an entire generation of Spanish communists caught up in complicated and turbulent times.\n\nThe documentation behind Storm the Skies is phenomenal. Never-before-seen photos, newsreels and clippings come from archives in Mexico, Spain, France, Cuba and the former Soviet Union as well as (presumably) the private collections of the many interviewees. The aged witnesses to history happily tell their personal stories of the Spanish Civil War as well as explain their connection to RamÃƒÂ³n Mercader. The Spanish-produced show allows them all to speak their minds, giving us an appreciation of a group of people that have different political ideas, yet are definitely not &quot;enemies of freedom.&quot;\n\nStorm the Skies starts with the story of RamÃƒÂ³n Mercader's mother Caridad, a rebellious young bride from a privileged, liberal family who rejected her husband after having five children with him. More interested in the vibrant political life in the cafÃƒÂ©s of Barcelona, Caridad took her children to France, returning only when the Spanish Republic was founded. The film covers the Spanish Civil War through the experience of interviewee witnesses who were among hundreds of children shipped to the Soviet Union for safekeeping. Coddled by the sympathetic Russians, the Spanish children (many of whom were orphaned) grew up with conflicted national identities. They certainly didn't consider themselves Russians, but when some returned to Franco's Spain in the 1950s they discovered they had little in common with their own relatives.\n\nCaridad became a fiery communist dedicated to the destruction of capitalism. Her son RamÃƒÂ³n was also committed to the cause and, using his mother's connections, trained to become a deep-cover assassin in the late 1930s. Stalin wanted Leon Trotsky dead for political and personal reasons, and RamÃƒÂ³n dedicated his life to that cause alone. Speaking perfect English, Mercader moved to New York and managed to meet and start a relationship with a young woman in Trotsky's inner circle. He eventually went with her to Mexico City. After a bungled attempt by other Stalinist agents, Mercader succeeded in killing his prey with an ice climber's pickaxe, and was captured. According to the witnesses here, RamÃƒÂ³n's mother Caridad was waiting in a getaway car outside the Trotsky compound, but he didn't have a chance to escape.\n\nWe pay even closer attention to Storm the Skies' witnesses from this point on, as they become a resource as precious as the interviewees seen in Warren Beatty's 1980 Reds, the 1920s activists who remembered American communist John Reed. Most of the witnesses are not identified by name, and we have to listen to learn how they figure into the larger story. Convicted of murder in a Mexican court and sentenced to a long prison term, RamÃƒÂ³n was almost released after four years, but his notorious mother made a trip to Mexico at the wrong time and attracted publicity that kept that from happening. In prison, Mercader was visited by the Spanish movie star Sara (Sarita) Montiel (!!!) who sympathized with his plight. It sounds impossible until we see Ms. Montiel in person providing her memories of the story. Mercader served his full 20 years, getting out just as Castro took Cuba. He split his time between Havana and Moscow and was given the Soviet Union's highest honor. Mercader married -- his wife remembers telling him to wear his medal so they could skip to the front of the lines in the supermarket. Caridad Mercader died, with the oath that as an individual egotist she was made to fight capitalism but no good at building socialism.\n\nStorm the Skies provokes thought by giving us a point of view directly opposed to what we're used to hearing in the Western media. These citizens of the old Soviet Union look like retirees in a rest home, sweet-looking old folks still proud to be communists. They have no problem with the fact that Stalin destroyed Lenin and Trotsky's perpetually self-renewing revolution at the earliest opportunity. The witnesses do not mention that Stalin had several of Trotsky's relative murdered, even some of his own children. The docu does say that Trotsky was sexually unfaithful to his wife Natalia Sedowa, and states that the reason he had to stop living as a guest with Frida Kahlo was that Natalia discovered their affair.\n\nAs even more evidence of the selective memories and moral blindness of some of the witnesses, several insist that RamÃƒÂ³n Mercader is a hero, and become misty-eyed at his memory. They compare Mercader to a soldier in a war, but he still comes off as a loathsome assassin, striking down a defenseless and harmless man. The only significant thing in his life was to use stealth, cruel deception and ruthless violence to murder on behalf of a ruthless dictator. Absolving Mercader opens a moral door to killing people wholesale or individually, on the basis of the ideas they promote or the thoughts they think.
