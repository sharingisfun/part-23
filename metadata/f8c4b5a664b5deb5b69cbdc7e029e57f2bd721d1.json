HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s everything Luke isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fine with Olivia.\n\nNow, seven years later, Olivia is older, wiser and headed back to Chicago looking forward to a fresh start and reconnecting with her best friend Pyper. What she doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t expect, is to come face to face with the boy she left behind and discover that even though she may have left, her feelings for him didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t. \n\nCan Olivia put aside the pain in her heart and trust Luke? Will the ties to her past ever let her go, or will she continue to let her life be affected by pretty little lies?\n\n\nSeed and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f8c4b5a664b5deb5b69cbdc7e029e57f2bd721d1","amp;dn":"Pretty+Little+Lies+by+Jennifer+Miller+%5BMU%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f8c4b5a664b5deb5b69cbdc7e029e57f2bd721d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,196,181,166,100,181,222,181,182,156,189,199,224,41,229,127,43,215,33,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
