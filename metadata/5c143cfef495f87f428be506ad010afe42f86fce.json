This album is somewhat different from the debut as it has no more rapping on the tracks, and has a more trip hop influenced element. The some of the tracks was produced by Raymond Watts of KMFDM fame, Howard Gray Of Apollo 440 and even Harley Davidson. due to the controversy that surrounded Caucasian's B-side Cop Killer a new version which was made and Derek said he apparently made 'on a night when two cops had been shot'[1] was included in the song &quot;Semtex Revolution&quot;.\n\nTrack listing\n01 Rev. \n02 Semtex Revolution \n03 Radio K.I.L.L. \n04 Scanning \n05 Rev.
