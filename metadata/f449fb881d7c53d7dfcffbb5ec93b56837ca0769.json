Ohtsu (Springer, 2008).pdf\r\n\r\nThis volume focuses on nano-optical probing, manipulation, and analysis. It begins with recent developments in near-field optical spectroscopy that clarify quantum states at the nanoscale, followed by a theory for a photon-electron-phonon interacting system at the nanoscale. Further topics include: visible laser desorption/ionization mass spectroscopy exhibiting near-field effects; a practical nanofabrication method with optical near fields applied to a SHG device; a theory and experimental achievements on optical transport of nanoparticles, selectively manipulated by resonant radiation force. Taken as a whole, this overview will be a valuable resource for engineers and scientists working in the field of nano-electro-optics","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f449fb881d7c53d7dfcffbb5ec93b56837ca0769","amp;dn":"Progress+in+Nano-Electro-Optics+VI+-+Nano-Optical+Probing%2C+Manip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f449fb881d7c53d7dfcffbb5ec93b56837ca0769","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,73,251,136,29,124,83,215,223,207,251,181,236,147,181,104,55,202,7,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
