When he sets out to pursue his dream of  \n acting, the grocery clerk finds an assortment of people \n waiting to dash his dreams: his acting coach (William   \n Baldwin), who has designs on his sister Peggy (24's     \n Mary Lynn Rajskub); his juvenile-delinquent friends,    \n who suck him into their petty crimes; and his           \n God-fearing, self-loathing mother (Academy Award        \n nominee Kathleen Quinlan). Through it all, Tracy        \n remains irrepressibly upbeat, convinced he's destined   \n for something big.                                      \n                                                         \n\n\n\n\n  C A S T  \n\n\n                                                         \n                                                         \n             Hubbel Palmer ...
