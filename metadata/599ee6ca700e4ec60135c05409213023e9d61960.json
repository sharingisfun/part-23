Singer and songwriter were simply made for each other. The core sound of the Fischer-Dieskau voice, the vast range of colours he can bring to bear, the control of the extremes of dynamic range, the unfailing sensitivity to the texts - everything just works. And the early to mid-1970s (the period covered by these studio recordings, as opposed to the live concert recording with Sviatoslav Richter) found Fischer-Dieskau at his peak in terms of the subtle balance between personal and vocal maturity. \n\nThere are six CDs here - 152 songs looking back to Schubert and then way forward into the 20th century: love songs, drinking songs, songs carrying an aching love of nature, ballads both heroic and amusing - not all solid gold, but Fischer-Dieskau's identification with each number is rarely less than total. The best way in is via the MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rike-Lieder, with such bewitching songs as &quot;Verbogenheit&quot;, &quot;Auf einer Wanderung&quot; and the spellbinding &quot;Auf eine Aeolsharfe&quot; - then follow your nose from there. As for Daniel Barenboim: he never misses a trick!\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:599ee6ca700e4ec60135c05409213023e9d61960","amp;dn":"Hugo+Wolf+-+Lieder+%28Fischer-Dieskau%2C+Barenboim%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"599ee6ca700e4ec60135c05409213023e9d61960","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,158,230,202,112,14,78,198,1,53,192,84,9,33,48,35,233,214,25,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
