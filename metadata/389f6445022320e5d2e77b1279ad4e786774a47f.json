Castellari (Inglorious Bastards) Cold Eyes Of        \n    Fear is a stylish and extravagant Italian &quot;giallo&quot; thriller. Set in      \n    swinging '60s London, this movie brings you a dark and decadent world    \n    of corrupt cops, vengeful ex-cons, threats, betrayals, fist-fights       \n    and feisty femme fatales.                                                \n                                                                             \n    Motivated by revenge, an ex-con abducts the son of the judge who put     \n    him behind bars. The plot thickens as a deeper betrayal is revealed,     \n    leading the story to erotic S&amp;M scenes with scantily-clad women and      \n    violent trysts in darkened, atmospheric nightclub settings.
