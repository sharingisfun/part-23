This clever guide focuses on fun, homemade projects using materials anyone can find around the house or that can be purchased for a fraction of what a commercially-produced toy can cost. Using everyday objects from cardboard tubing to paper to clothespins, readers will discover how to make such projects as:\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ A milk carton balloon boat\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ A rubber band banjo\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ A cardboard tube kaleidoscope\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ An embroidery hoop tambourine\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ And more\n\nPerfect for parents and teachers, these projects enable families to spend less while keeping entertained. Because fun doesn't always have to come in a box-sometimes, it's the box itself.\n\nAbout the Author\nHeather Swain is a former third-grade teacher, mother of two, writing instructor, magazine fact-checker, freelance writer, and award- winning author.
