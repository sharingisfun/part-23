The Lab Rats have discovered that the virtual reality ties in to the user's subconscious as well as to the mainframe to get information, with disastrous and fatal results. Now it's all they can do to stay alive long enough to escape the system.\n\nWritten and illustrated by John Byrne and published by DC Comics.\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:30279099afa62487e3ec04a8080181f840b6a964","amp;dn":"Lab+Rats","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"30279099afa62487e3ec04a8080181f840b6a964","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,39,144,153,175,166,36,135,227,236,4,168,8,1,129,248,64,182,169,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
