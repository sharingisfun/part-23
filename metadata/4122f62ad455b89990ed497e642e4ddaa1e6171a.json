But they\nall sang in english, which is odd because english was universally\na second language to them, as evidenced by the fact that the lyrics\nmake no sense and the vocalists have thick accents of indeterminate\norigin. Still, despite these shortcomings, the music kicks ass, and\nis recognized as the world's first completely electronic commercial\ndance music, predating House, Techno, Electro, and just about\neverything else. The music is seriously stupid good fun once you get\npast its dated, tinny sound. I now have ten times more of this music\nthan any other genre. And I might very well start spinning it too.\nNo, I'm serious. You don't believe me, do you?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4122f62ad455b89990ed497e642e4ddaa1e6171a","amp;dn":"THE+ITALO+NON-STOP+MEGAMIX+%28BEST+SONGS+SELECTED%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4122f62ad455b89990ed497e642e4ddaa1e6171a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,34,246,42,212,85,184,153,144,237,73,126,100,46,77,218,161,230,23,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
