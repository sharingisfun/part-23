It was written by manga creator Eiichiro Oda himself. It was directed by Munehisa Sakai.\nNews of the movie first appeared during a showing of the Episode of Chopper Plus, during which a teaser for the tenth movie was revealed. The movie was originally meant for a spring release in 2009, but complications with the script pushed the release date back. Eventually, the movie premiered on December 12, 2009. On July 28, 2012, FUNimation announced that they had acquired the license to One Piece Film: Strong World, but no release date has been revealed yet.\n\nAs stated, the film is an original story written by Eiichiro Oda himself in honor of One Piece's Tenth Anniversary. In previous films, Oda only supplied character designs and approved story ideas. For One Piece Film: Strong World, Toei personally asked if he would write the script. The movie is set between the Thriller Bark Arc and the Sabaody Archipelago Arc, as Brook is shown alongside the other Straw Hat Pirates (making this his first movie appearance), and Sengoku and Garp are still in their positions in the Marines.\n\nAs a promotion for the movie, the first 1.5 million Japanese moviegoers who went to see One Piece Film: Strong World received Volume 0 of the manga. The &quot;0th Volume&quot; bonus gift depicts the world of One Piece 20 years ago, and is directly linked to the movie Ã¢â‚¬â€ in particular, it depicts the war between the &quot;Pirate King&quot; Gol D. Roger and the legendary pirate &quot;Golden Lion&quot; Shiki.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:92f9d9cc0e6a1fc187f9f08dc131285527aa1a7c","amp;dn":"ONE+PIECE+FILM-+Strongworld","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"92f9d9cc0e6a1fc187f9f08dc131285527aa1a7c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,249,217,204,14,106,31,193,135,249,240,141,193,49,40,85,39,170,26,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
