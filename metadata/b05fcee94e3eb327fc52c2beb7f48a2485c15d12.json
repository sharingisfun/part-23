And I mean AS FAR AS IT CAN GO. As tasteless as it is fun, and it's a fuckin' blast. If you thought THE CANDY SNATCHERS was horrifying and offensive, you might want to sit this one out. If, on the other hand, you thought THE CANDY SNATCHERS was a religious experience beamed down directly from the brain of almighty God for the benefit of humankind -- well, then you might want to wear a diaper for BONNIE'S KIDS, 'cause you're gonna SHIT! A slam-bang frontal assault of sleaze. This will be one of the greatest moviegoing experiences of your life. Mark my words. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b05fcee94e3eb327fc52c2beb7f48a2485c15d12","amp;dn":"Bonnie%5C%27s+Kids+%281973%29+-+DVDRip+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b05fcee94e3eb327fc52c2beb7f48a2485c15d12","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,95,206,233,78,62,179,39,252,82,194,190,183,244,138,36,133,193,93,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
