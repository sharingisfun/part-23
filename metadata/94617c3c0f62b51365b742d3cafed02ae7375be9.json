Hinton, whose novels are as relevant as ever, exploring sibling relationships, the importance of role models, and the courage to think independently.\n\nRusty-James is the number one tough guy among the junior high kids who hang out and shoot pool at Benny's. He's even proud of keeping up his reputation. Actually though, what he wants most of all is to be just like his older brother, the Motorcycle Boy. Rusty-James isn't book-smart, he relies more on his fists than his brains. When he gets in over his head, the Motorcycle Boy has always been there to bail him out. The day Rusty-James' world comes apart, the Motorcycle boy isn't around to pick up the pieces. What now?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:94617c3c0f62b51365b742d3cafed02ae7375be9","amp;dn":"Rumble+Fish+By+S.E.+Hinto","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"94617c3c0f62b51365b742d3cafed02ae7375be9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,97,124,60,15,98,181,19,101,183,66,211,202,254,208,42,231,55,91,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
