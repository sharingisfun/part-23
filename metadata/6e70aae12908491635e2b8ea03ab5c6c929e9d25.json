The album is extensively produced, not only in the sense of beat-\ncomposition in which Automator has done a splendid job with, but in which \neverything is presented; the story wrapped and maintained, the mixing of \nsounds so preciously placed. The album evokes a sense of awe; a truly \nbelievable tale, undoubtedly meant to be played from beginning to end. It\\\\\\'s \nwondrously layered with topics such as virus\\\\\\', turbulence and apocalyptic \nvisions of the world, right on down to mass confusion from which of course \nleads to madness. One can not help but be taken aback by this finely crafted \nand conceived visual tale.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e70aae12908491635e2b8ea03ab5c6c929e9d25","amp;dn":"Deltron+3030+-+Deltron+3030+%282000%29+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e70aae12908491635e2b8ea03ab5c6c929e9d25","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,112,170,225,41,8,73,22,53,226,184,234,3,171,92,108,146,158,157,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
