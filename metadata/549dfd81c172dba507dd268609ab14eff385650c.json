On a smaller screen you'll never notice it, but if you are viewing on a full size monitor the file will open a bit too large. Just shrink it a little and enjoy!\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:549dfd81c172dba507dd268609ab14eff385650c","amp;dn":"It+Ain%27t+Me+Babe+%28Underground+-+Restored%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"549dfd81c172dba507dd268609ab14eff385650c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,157,253,129,193,114,219,165,7,221,38,134,9,171,20,239,243,133,101,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
