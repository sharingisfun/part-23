He had done a few big band albums that sounded like Doc Severson plugged into Frank Zappa'a sound system, and was opening a lot of rock shows, back in the era when you could get rock and roll kids to listen to and appreciate jazz. \n\nSo, Billy Friedkin makes French Connection, and gets Don to score it. Billy must have known he had a hit on his hands, and wanted a big name to put on the composer credit. Ellis does an entire, half hour score for the movie. Not a lot of this music made it into the film: evidently, Billy wanted to have a gritty film with lots of street noises, and, tastefully edited Don's score to bare bones. It works in the movie, but a lot of really good music never saw the light of day.\n\nThat is, until this CD was released on 2002. This is Ellis' full score: big band funk jazz, with lots of dark overtones, light and shades, and very creepy dynamics. This is the music of early 70s new york; men in fadoras and black ties walking down rainy ally ways. Sun setting over burned out buildings. Ellis has blasts of sound, followed by menacing, whispering synthasizer passages. His trumput is sometimes a creeping flashlight, sometimes a machine gun. It ecchos, screams, and moans like a junkie.\n\nFrench Connection II, where the Frog kidnaps Doyle and hooks him to junk, was made in 1975. Ellis does an equally atmospheric score, slightly more funky, as this type of music had by 75' seeped far deeper into jazz. The film takes place in France, but the score has equal impact.\n\nYou don't hear a lot of this type of music anymore, especially on film soundtracks. Completely atmospheric, emotional music. Brillant work.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklist:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe French Connection I Soundtrack  (1971)\n\n01.
