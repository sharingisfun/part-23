Dutch diplomat Oscar Verschuur has been posted to neutral Switzerland. His family is spread across Europe. His wife Kate works as a nurse in London and their daughter Emma is living in Berlin with her husband Carl, a 'good' German who works at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nBriefly reunited with her father in a restaurant in Geneva, Emma drops a bombshell. A date and a codename, and the fate of nations is placed in Verschuur's hands: June 22, Barbarossa.\n\nWhat should he do? Warn the world, or put his daughter's safety first? The Gestapo are watching them both. And with Stalin lulled by his alliance with Hitler, will anyone even listen?\n\nOtto de Kat is gaining a reputation as one of Europe's subtlest and most economical writers. News from Berlin, his most commerical work yet, is a true page-turner driven by the pulse of a ticking clock, and is certain to be his breakthrough novel.\n\nGenre: Fiction/Historical","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a7ef9814449bf1835466b1212c9b963116f4db57","amp;dn":"News+from+Berlin+by+Otto+de+Kat","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a7ef9814449bf1835466b1212c9b963116f4db57","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,239,152,20,68,155,241,131,84,102,177,33,44,155,150,49,22,244,219,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
