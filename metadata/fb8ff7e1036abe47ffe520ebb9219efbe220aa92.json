It was compiled as a companion to another album: Red Hot + Rio, a contemporary pop album paying tribute to this same body of music and many of the same songs.\n\n   In the hope that Red Hot + Rio would ignite interest in Brazilian music within the X-Generation, Verve simultaneously released a historical survey with similar cover art, similar noise interludes between tracks, and occasionally, the same tunes (do not be confused!). Although some of the same old stuff reissued a thousand times before is here (the Stan Getz/JoÃƒÂ£o Gilberto &quot;The Girl from Ipanema,&quot; and the Stan Getz/Charlie Byrd &quot;Desafinado&quot; et al), Verve also went through the trouble to unearth some unusual items. Among the prizes on Nova Bossa: Red Hot on Verve are a bizarre track by organist Walter Wanderley called &quot;Bicho Do Mato,&quot; Edu Lobo's marvelous high-energy original version of his &quot;Upa, Neguinho,&quot; and Sergio Mendes' folk-like back-to-the-roots treatment of &quot;After Sunrise.&quot; Commendably, half of the CD is devoted to songs by composers other than Antonio Carlos Jobim -- worthy figures like Lobo, Jorge Ben, Baden Powell, JoÃƒÂ£o Gilberto, Caetano Veloso and Gilberto Gil. Not all bases are adequately covered, however, there is no tropicalismo beyond its late-'60s infancy and there is nothing from a giant like Milton Nascimento. Still, this is one of those rare collections that will appeal to the newcomer and the connoisseur.
