Electro-magnetic technologies offer unlimited potential to processing applications in foods. Industrially, electro-technologies provide unique opportunities and advantages not necessarily found in other techniques. The book series will look at each of them in detail especially from point of view of various industrial food processing applications. Notable among novel approaches in heating and food processing techniques are microwave and radio-frequency heating, electrical resistance or ohmic heating, induction and infra-red heating applications. Use of pulsed electric fields, high frequency magnetic fields, electric shockwaves, pulsed light, UV radiation and ionizing irradiations offer potential non-thermal alternatives to food processing. Each book will be devoted to a specific area of electro-technology covering all aspects of its science and engineering, chemistry and physics, biochemistry and nutrition, quality and safety, development and technology, both basic and applied","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c82d3eec58d7ac5433ab92750cfee6264cc9fab6","amp;dn":"Electro-Technologies+for+Food+Processing+Series","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c82d3eec58d7ac5433ab92750cfee6264cc9fab6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,45,62,236,88,215,172,84,51,171,146,117,12,254,230,38,76,201,250,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
