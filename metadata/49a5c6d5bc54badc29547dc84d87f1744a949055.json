Global interest is huge - not least as a result of one of his four The Scream paintings having recently set a public art auction record of $120 million. Many know Munch as the man who painted The Scream, but his complete works are remarkable and secure his place as one of the greatest artists to have ever lived.\r\nMunch 150 is co-hosted by the National Museum and the Munch Museum, both in Oslo. With 220 paintings on show, it brings together the greatest number of Munch's key works in one place.\r\nThis event film will be going behind-the-scenes to show some of the process of putting the exhibition together - as well as providing an in-depth biography of a man who lived from the mid-19th century right through to the German occupation of Norway in the Second World War. Special guests will also offer their expert insight and knowledge to host Tim Marlow. Munch 150: A superb art exhibition and a fantastic event film.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f1/Edvard-Munch-Seventh-Arts-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/8e/Edvard-Munch-Seventh-Arts-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/ae/Edvard-Munch-Seventh-Arts-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/3c/Edvard-Munch-Seventh-Arts-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/0a/Edvard-Munch-Seventh-Arts-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/9a/Edvard-Munch-Seventh-Arts-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f5/Edvard-Munch-Seventh-Arts-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/0a/Edvard-Munch-Seventh-Arts-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f4/Edvard-Munch-Seventh-Arts-Screen8.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: CRF 18 (~1004Kbps)\r\n * Video Resolution: 854x480\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\n * Frames Rate: 30000/1001 FPS\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC-LC\r\n * Audio Bitrate: Q=0.45 VBR 48KHz (~109Kbps)\r\n * Audio Channels: 2\r\n * Run-Time: 87 mins\r\n * Number Of Parts: 1\r\n * Part Size: 704 MB\r\n * Source: DVD\r\n * Subtitles: Merged English, French, German and Norwegian\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://www.seventh-art.com/shop/exhibition-munch-150/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:49a5c6d5bc54badc29547dc84d87f1744a949055","amp;dn":"Exhibition+on+Screen+2013+Edvard+Munch+From+the+National+Gallery","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"49a5c6d5bc54badc29547dc84d87f1744a949055","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,165,198,213,188,84,186,220,41,84,125,200,77,135,241,116,74,148,144,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
