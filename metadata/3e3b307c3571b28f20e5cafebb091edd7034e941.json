Though the minor hits &quot;Wonder&quot; and &quot;Jealousy&quot; bore a reasonable resemblance to Merchant's work with 10,000 Maniacs, most of Tigerlily clearly established her as a solo artist apart from her former band. The record's first single, &quot;Carnival,&quot; drove that point home, with a hook based more on rhythm than melody and the haunting voice of Katell Keineg adding an intriguing dimension to the chorus. Elsewhere, much of Tigerlily is remarkably solemn and subtle, from the low-key opener &quot;San Andreas Fault&quot; to the widower's lament &quot;My Beloved Wife&quot; to the eight-minute opus &quot;I May Know the Word.&quot; Also of note is &quot;River,&quot; an emotional ode to friend and fallen star River Phoenix.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e3b307c3571b28f20e5cafebb091edd7034e941","amp;dn":"%5B1995%5D+Natalie+Merchant+-+Tigerlily+%5BCDRip+-+flac%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e3b307c3571b28f20e5cafebb091edd7034e941","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,59,48,124,53,113,178,143,32,229,202,254,187,9,30,221,112,52,233,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
