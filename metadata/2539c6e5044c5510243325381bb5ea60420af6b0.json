But they persevered and earned a contract with Reprise Records, releasing their self-titled debut album in June 2002. Having only played a handful of shows around Orem prior to their record's release, the band -- vocalist Bert McCracken, guitarist Quinn Allman, bassist Jeph Howard, and drummer Branden Steineckert -- began relentless nationwide touring that quickly saw their fan base multiply. Club dates soon turned into successful stints on larger-scale festival/package tours including the Warped Tour, Ozzfest, and Projekt Revolution alongside Linkin Park and Snoop Dogg. In the summer of 2003, the Used issued the introspective CD/DVD Maybe Memories, which contained unreleased songs, live material, behind-the-scenes footage, and more.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2539c6e5044c5510243325381bb5ea60420af6b0","amp;dn":"The+Used+-+The+Ocean+of+the+Sky+EP+%282013%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2539c6e5044c5510243325381bb5ea60420af6b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,57,198,229,4,76,85,16,36,51,37,56,27,181,234,96,66,10,246,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
