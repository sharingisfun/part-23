She desperately needs a few things that her moral values can't buy: food, shelter, a chance for a better life. Connor Montgomery is tortured with guilt from the past and wants only one thing from Jessica, something he's very willing to pay her for. Setting her up as his mistress seems like the perfect idea. But how long can a situation continue that was a mistake from the very beginning? \n\n\nSeed and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:38884ccdff8d88e8c02559b5b31a45f073b43b73","amp;dn":"The+Mistress+Mistake+by+Lynda+Chance+%5BMU%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"38884ccdff8d88e8c02559b5b31a45f073b43b73","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,136,76,205,255,141,136,232,192,37,89,181,179,26,69,240,115,180,59,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
