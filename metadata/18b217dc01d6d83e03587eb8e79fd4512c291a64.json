Scientists have had to put themselves right inside a raging\navalanche to find out more.\n\nStewart shows how the deadliest avalanche in history killed 18,000 people in\nthree minutes; how Hannibal's army was devastated by avalanches as he crossed\nthe Alps to fight Rome; why an avalanche was key to one of the greatest aviation\nmysteries of all time; and how global warming may increase the rate of ice\navalanches in the future.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nA short sample is included for evaluation.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:18b217dc01d6d83e03587eb8e79fd4512c291a64","amp;dn":"10+Things+You+Didn%27t++Know+About+Avalanches++%28BBC+2008%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"18b217dc01d6d83e03587eb8e79fd4512c291a64","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,178,23,220,1,214,216,62,3,88,126,184,231,159,212,81,44,41,26,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
