Although two songs are by Harold Arlen, the composers were in most cases less prolific than the ones she saluted in her songbook series. Ella is backed by a large unidentified orchestra conducted and arranged by Frank DeVol. Swingers alternate with ballads, and as usual, Ella uplifts everything, including &quot;Let's Fall In Love,&quot; &quot;Moonlight Serenade,&quot; &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; and &quot;East of the Sun.&quot; An enjoyable if not classic release. \n\n\n01. Sweet And Lovely \n02. Let's Fall In Love    \n03. Makin' Whoopee  \n04. That Old Feeling \n05. I Remember You  \n06. Moonlight Serenade  \n07. Gone With The Wind  \n08. Can't We Be Friends? \n09. Out Of This World \n10. My Old Flame \n11. East Of The Sun (And West Of The Moon)\n12.
