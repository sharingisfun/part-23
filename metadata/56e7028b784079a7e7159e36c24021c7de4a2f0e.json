The second edition of this highly praised bestseller explores the scientific and technological developments of existing and new light sources and significantly expands the coverage on how to make choices based on a specific application.\n\nNew to the Second Edition\n\nEnhanced material on LEDs\nNew chapter on matching lighting technology with the appropriate applications\nNew chapter on light and health\nNew case studies on indoor and outdoor lighting for security and safety\n\nThis book provides an up-to-date guide to the main technologies and important families of light sources that have dominated the market and our lives since the end of the nineteenth century. It will help readers design the most appropriate lighting environments for people of various needs and choose the correct technology for cost-effective lighting schemes.\n\nEditorial Reviews\nReview\n\n&quot;Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ a must-read for people looking for a complete introduction to this very modern subject. Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ this book covers from legacy light sources to new solid state lighting devices, in combination with aspects of lighting and health effects. I strongly recommend this book!&quot;\nÃ¢â‚¬â€¢Professor Georges Zissis, University of Toulouse, France\n\n&quot;In this book a nice overview is given of all the lighting technologies that we use today and many new entrants in the world of lighting will benefit from reading it.&quot;\nÃ¢â‚¬â€¢Dr. Marco Haverlag, Philips Lighting, The Netherlands\n\nPraise for the First Edition:\n&quot;Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ a welcome publication, written as it is by an expert on light sources Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ it is a book that will prove useful to those who teach lighting subjects and who have to deal with light sources.&quot;\nÃ¢â‚¬â€¢Robert Bean, Lighting Research and Technology, 2011\n\n&quot;Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ a concise compilation of a huge family of ancient and modern light sources. As a reference book, it will be useful to scientists, students and professionals who deal with light sources and their applications in spectroscopy, optics and industry.&quot;\nÃ¢â‚¬â€¢Optics &amp; Photonics News, 2011\n\n&quot;Upon finishing this book, you will be impressed by how the author has managed to squeeze such a comprehensive look at light sources into 213 pages. Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ Of particular value is the authorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ability to condense the amount of complex information into an easy-to-read, concise and logical manner. In fact, it is a delight to run through such a complete Ã¢â‚¬Ëœrefresher courseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ in a few hoursÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ reading. Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ this book offers a good overview of all current light sources from the older technologies up to the most current. Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ As a reference book for the lighting professional, it is a very good Ã¢â‚¬ËœrefresherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ on all areas of lighting, which explains why and where we are in the story of lighting. Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ it will undoubtedly teach you a thing or two that you did not know about the subject.&quot;\nÃ¢â‚¬â€¢Lighting Journal, February 2011\nAbout the Author\n\nSpiros Kitsinelis is an associate professor at Ehime University. His research focuses on the development of novel and energy-efficient light sources and the communication of this science to a broader audience. Dr. Kitsinelis is the co-creator of several patents in the field of light sources and the author of numerous scientific publications, including the book The Right Light: Matching Technologies to Needs and Applications.
