When she is finally ready to move forward with her life, she embarks on a getaway vacation to Miami, determined to find healing from the painful memories in her past. Damien Wales also has a tragic past that has left him a cold and distant person. However, the moment he sees Allison, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s inexplicably drawn to her, and he is a man who will stop at nothing to get what he wants. A sunset stroll brings the two together. Allison feels an undeniable attraction to Damien, but sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hesitant to get close to anyone. Damien will do everything he can to keep Allison in his life, but his overprotective and domineering demeanor might just push her away. When DamienÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dark past begins to collide with his present, AllisonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life is put in danger. Damien must keep her safe, but some things are just out of his control. Trust Me is the first book in the Trust Series.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:535ec36d9eec00666af4bac8b467266894f89e55","amp;dn":"Trust+Me+by+Kristin+Mayer+%5BePub%5D+-+Traitor","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"535ec36d9eec00666af4bac8b467266894f89e55","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,94,195,109,158,236,0,102,106,244,186,200,180,103,38,104,148,248,158,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
