(You only need to use one of these methods)\n\nCompressed with Winrar. Both Games were tested and work.\n\nNote: you can extract winrar formats with 7-Zip, 7-Zip is free.\n\nWanted to upload this because the download links for this game had expired or were deleted, and couldn't find any good live torrents for this.  So any one previously looking for this you can rest at ease, here it is. This 2-disc game was at first a pain to find, but luckly I finally got it.  Hope you like it.\n\n\nGame Describtion:\n\nBoth games are actually ports from the original Arcade Laserdisc versions to the playstation and are fmv type games, like braindead 13 for example, or dragon's lair. This was also released for the Sega Saturn as well. I really couldn't find a proper description anywhere for this 2-disc set psx game, so here's my version.  Not much else to say but this is good collection for any Playstation gamer, and hard to come by so I recommend downloading this while you can.\n\n\n\nBurn with Alcohol 120% (Included in download). \n\nset datatype setting to playstation when burning.\n\nUse Verbatim or Tayio Yuden CD Media, Verbatim is recommended and probably your best bet.\n\n\nGamepics included.\n\n\nAny Problems, or questions please post a comment.\n\n\nPlease Seed This.\n\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e74335193466aa9aaac580082c4f8de9491722ee","amp;dn":"%5BPsx%5D+%5BNtsc-J%5D+Thunder+Storm+LX-3+%26+RoadBlaster+%282-Disc+Set%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e74335193466aa9aaac580082c4f8de9491722ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,67,53,25,52,102,170,154,170,197,128,8,44,79,141,233,73,23,34,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
