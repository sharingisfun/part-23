Hiscox\n\nA fascinating compendium of early-twentieth-century mechanical devices, this wide-ranging work covers a variety of applications.  More than 1800 engravings - ranging from simple diagrams to detailed cross-sections - illustrate the workings of each item, from simple hooks and levers to complex machinery used in steam, motive, hydraulic, air, and electric power, navigation, gearing, clocks, mining, construction, and more.\n\nCompiled as a ready reference for inventors, students of mechanics, artisans and other workers, this volume features only minimal text.  It's true value lies in it's wealth of illustrated information, offering the quickest and most satisfactory method of conveying the exact conditions of mechanical action and construction.\n\n416 Pages,\n400 dpi","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:066495451d214d7c9e1b2705d6c450871d871742","amp;dn":"1800+Mechanical+Movements%2C+Devices+and+Appliances","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"066495451d214d7c9e1b2705d6c450871d871742","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,100,149,69,29,33,77,124,158,27,39,5,214,196,80,135,29,135,23,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
