The objective is to find a flower, Blood Orchid, that flourishes for a couple of weeks every seven years and could be a fountain of youth, prolonging the expectation of life of human beings. They are succeeded and once in Borneo, they realize that it is the raining season and there is no boat available to navigate on the river. They pay US$ 50,000.00 to convince Captain Bill Johnson and his partner Tran to sail to the location. After an accident in a waterfall, the survivors realize that a pack of anacondas have gathered for mating and their nest is nearby the plantation of Blood Orchid, which made them bigger and bigger. \n\n\nVideo: x264; 1280x528; 4686 kbps; 23.976 fps\n\nAudio 1: Russian Dub\nAudio 2: DTS 5.1 Ch 768 kbps (Select Audio 2)\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a0d88cdfa1be654e133d75d2ffed1f25947a533c","amp;dn":"Anacondas.The.Hunt.For.The.Blood.Orchid.2004.HDTV.720p.DTS-HD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a0d88cdfa1be654e133d75d2ffed1f25947a533c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,216,140,223,161,190,101,78,19,61,117,210,255,237,31,37,148,122,83,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
