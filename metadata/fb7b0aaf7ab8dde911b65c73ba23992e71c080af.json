Rather than release them in two separate torrents as they were initially released, I've made you wait a tiny bit longer so I could download and convert both for a single convenient upload for ya' ;)  Of course, the bad news in this is that then we only have four episodes left in the season :(  However, as many of you may have seen, I posted the news that Star Wars:  The Clone Wars has been picked up for a full Second Season!  If you missed the news, you can read about it here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thefutoncritic.com/news.aspx?id=20090209cartoon01&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thefutoncritic.com/news.aspx?id=20090209cartoon01&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThe first episode, &quot;Blue Shadow Virus&quot;, is quite good, and has some fairly good Jedi action.  Plus, we're back in the swamps and rolling fields of Naboo, so if you liked Episodes I &amp; II, you should definitely enjoy the scenery.  The second episode, &quot;Mystery of a Thousand Moons&quot; was even better, and I loved the suspense even though I knew it would all turn out OK in the end.  Overall, tonight was a great night!!\n\nS01E17 - &quot;Blue Shadow Virus&quot;\nVideo Bitrate........: 1.18 mbits/sec\nResolution...........: 624 x 352\nFPS..................: 23.98\nView Online Preview..: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.starwars.com/video/view/000762.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.starwars.com/video/view/000762.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPadmÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© and Jar Jar are captured while searching for a secret Separatist bio-weapons lab, sparking Anakin, Obi-Wan and Ahsoka to try and save their friends and halt the release of a deadly virus.\n\n\nS01E18 - &quot;Mystery of a Thousand Moons&quot;\nVideo Bitrate........: 1.18 mbits/sec\nResolution...........: 624 x 352\nFPS..................: 23.98\nView Online Preview..: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.starwars.com/video/view/000767.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.starwars.com/video/view/000767.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThe fatal Blue Shadow Virus menace is still at large, infecting Ahsoka, PadmÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©, and many clone troopers -- and giving Anakin and Obi-Wan just 48 hours to find the antidote on a mysterious planet from which no visitor has returned. \n\nEnjoy, and May the Force Be With You!\n\n\nScreen Shots: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/swcw117a.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/swcw117a.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/swcw117b.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/swcw117b.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/swcw117c.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/swcw117c.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/swcw118a.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/swcw118a.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/swcw118b.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/swcw118b.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/swcw118c.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/swcw118c.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nYou can download Previous Episodes &amp; Star Wars films here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/VixenofVenus/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/VixenofVenus/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nExpect future torrents for the episodes of this show ... from VoV :)\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                 Additional Info\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLike all my iPod torrents, these files have their ID3 tags preformatted for your ease!  Album Art, Release Dates, and TV Tags are already filled out for you.  However, if you wish to change them, I recommend the third-party tagging program TVTagger.\n\nAfter downloading, please leave your client open and the torrent actively seeding so others may download as well and your ratio will remain high! Also remember not to severely limit your upload speed by over-throttling. Be kind, rewind! Remember to eat your green vegetables.
