Here&amp;#039;s some REAL rock from my hometown of Detroit.&quot;  He gave me a Bob Seger album and I became an instant fan.\n\nToday, I was cleaning up the iTunes library and thought &quot;Shit.  I used to listen to Bob Seger all the time.  And what great songs they are so I thought I&amp;#039;d share the library in a Mega music torrent.\n\nIncluded are some more obscure Seger tunes including the studio version of Turn The Page and some others from the rare album &quot;Back In 72&quot;\n\nIn the torrent you&amp;#039;ll find a PDF with a detailed playlist and a folder of album art.\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a8a7d402ac60e70e2da428334ba62253d2f9d404","amp;dn":"Bob+Seger+MEGA+Music","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a8a7d402ac60e70e2da428334ba62253d2f9d404","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,167,212,2,172,96,231,14,45,164,40,51,75,166,34,83,210,249,212,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
