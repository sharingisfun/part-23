The original Rogues Gallery in 2006 apparently came about when Willner was working with Depp on Pirates of the Caribbean, and both became fascinated by the songs that the pirates might have sung. \nAs on the original, a right rum bunch have been press-ganged into service: Tom Waits, Macy Gray, Beth Orton, Frank ZappaÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ And isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t this Michael StipeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first recording (Rio Grande, with Courtney Love) since R.E.M. split?\nThe very nature of sea shanties (or chanteys) is that they are intensely melodic and demand to be sung along to. They were originally intended to make the sailors work faster, because the old clipper captains reasoned, Ã¢â‚¬Å“If the men donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t sing right, the ship donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t move rightÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.\nSo you get Sean Lennon on the jaunty and aptly Liverpudlian Row Bullies Row, and Patti Smith and DeppÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s The Mermaid. WaitsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ gruff Shenandoah finds him in the company of that old pirate Keith Richards, while Iggy Pop makes a suitably bawdy contribution and the magnificent Richard Thompson gets under the skin of General Taylor.\nThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a sultry Dr John on In Lure of the Tropics, a macho Marc Almond (Ship in Distress), and a dissolute Leaving of Liverpool from Shane MacGowan, which leaves the impression of grog on the disc. But there are also poignant moments on TomÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Gone to Hilo (Gavin Friday and Shannon McNally) and Flandyke Shore (Marianne Faithfull with Kate and Anna McGarrigle).\nAll in all, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a refreshingly varied voyage. And if you want to stretch your sea legs further, set sail towards Highpoint/Topic RecordsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ 2004 collection, SailorsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Songs &amp; Sea ShantiesÃ¢â‚¬Â¦","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f1411a5769732d6aa7cf44266561c9042c536ef6","amp;dn":"Son+Of+Rogues+Gallery%3A+Pirate+Ballads%2C+Sea+Songs+and+Chanteys+%5B2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f1411a5769732d6aa7cf44266561c9042c536ef6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,65,26,87,105,115,45,106,167,207,68,38,101,97,201,4,44,83,110,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
