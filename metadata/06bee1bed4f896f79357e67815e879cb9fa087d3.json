With over 320 photographs, 32 extended interviews, and essays on the City's history and character, this reprint is not only an informative glimpse of a now vanished landmark but a sensitive and penetrating portrait of a unique community.\nProduct Details\n\n    * Paperback: 216 pages\n    * Publisher: Watermark (June 6, 1999)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 1873200137\n    * ISBN-13: 978-1873200131\n    * Product Dimensions: 10.6 x 10.4 x 0.9 inches\n    * Shipping Weight: 2.8 pounds\n    * Average Customer Review: 4.8 out of 5 stars  See all reviews (10 customer reviews)\n      10 Reviews\n      5 star: \t\n      \t (8)\n      4 star: \t\n      \t (2)\n      3 star: \t  \t (0)\n      2 star: \t  \t (0)\n      1 star: \t  \t (0)\n\n      ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âº See all 10 customer reviews...\n    * Amazon Bestsellers Rank: #589,468 in Books (See Top 100 in Books)\n      #29 in \t Books &gt; History &gt; Asia &gt; Hong Kong","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:06bee1bed4f896f79357e67815e879cb9fa087d3","amp;dn":"City+of+Darkness+-+Life+in+Kowloon+Walled+City+%281993%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"06bee1bed4f896f79357e67815e879cb9fa087d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,190,225,190,212,248,150,247,147,87,230,120,21,232,121,203,159,160,135,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
