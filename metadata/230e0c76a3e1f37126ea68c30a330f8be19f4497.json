The title character was played by Geraldine McEwan from the first to third series, until her retirement from the role, and by Julia McKenzie from the fourth series onwards.\n\nEach series consists of four feature-length episodes, except series six which only has three episodes. The first six episodes were all adaptations of Miss Marple novels by Christie. Subsequent episodes were derived both from works featuring Miss Marple but also Christie novels that did not feature the character. The title of the series removes the word Miss from Miss Marple, to match the title of the Agatha Christie's Poirot series.\n\nFollowing the conclusion of the sixth series, it was announced that the BBC had acquired the rights for the production of Agatha Christie adaptations, suggesting that ITV would be unable to make a seventh series of Marple.\n\n\nEpisode Descriptions Courtesy Of:\n\nThe On-Line Television Database\nAn Open Database for Television Fans &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.thetvdb.com/?tab=series&amp;id=78895&amp;lid=7&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.thetvdb.com/?tab=series&amp;id=78895&amp;lid=7&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n2010-08-30 - The Pale Horse (Video:H264 624x336, 898kbps, 25fps - Audio:AAC 44.1kHz, 103kbps)\n\nMiss MarpleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s old friend Father Gorman is brutally murdered after visiting the dying Mrs Davis.
