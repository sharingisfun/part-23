While most dipped no farther back than a few decades--a century at most--Thompson's musical memory rose to the challenge. The result is this concert set's encapsulation of 22 songs that trace a musical progression from the Middle Ages through Britney Spears, with Judith Owen and Debra Dobkin providing spare instrumental and rich vocal support. Released as a concert DVD with two audio CDs, the selection is irrepressibly idiosyncratic, from rounds, madrigals, and British balladry that recall Thompson's early days in Fairport Convention through the music-hall singalong of &quot;I Live in Trafalgar Square&quot; to dips into the songbooks of the Kinks (&quot;See My Friends&quot;), Squeeze (&quot;Tempted&quot;), and Bowling for Soup (&quot;1985&quot;). Among the highlights are the soulful tenderness of the 17th century's &quot;Bonnie St. Johnstone,&quot; a haunting &quot;Shenandoah,&quot; a samba arrangement of Cole Porter's &quot;Night and Day,&quot; and a deliriously rocking rendition of the Easybeats' &quot;Friday on My Mind.&quot;\n\nTracklist:\n\n01.
