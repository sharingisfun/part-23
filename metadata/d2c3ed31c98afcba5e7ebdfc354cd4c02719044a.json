It was, however, an act of exemplary parenting that would be applauded in child-rearing\nmanuals for years to come.\n\nFrom his back row position in the chorus of Pirates of Penzance, Alister could see that the production team was having issues with the shaggy-haired \nlighting man Ulrich Lenffer, whose need to hit things rhythmically made him useless at following the directors cues. When Ulrich escaped back-stage for \nsome time out, he befriended disillusioned bass player Jeremy Kelshaw, who was sulking in the green room because the conductor had confiscated his phuzz \npedal. They were soon joined by UlrichÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s sister Heidi Lenffer, who appeared concerned, not as much by the pirate costume she was wearing, as from the \nearnest faces of broken men.\n\nShe sat down to commiserate, and the three haunched figures swapped sorry tales beside the vending machine.\n\nJeremy was a frustrated creative visionary trying to channel his musical ambitions through his quad box; UlrichÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s compulsion for making beats had \nplagued him like an involuntary twitch; and Heidi had forced herself to attempt acting in an effort to lose the piano-nerd stereotype. It did not take \nlong for Alister- eavesdropping from the stalls- to join the forum, confessing that all he had ever really wanted to do was rock out.\nAnd so it was; the stars had aligned to make Cloud Control. Ten songs were written in the space of as many days, and the Blue Mountains have been slowly \neroding from the stampede of merry punters ever sinceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d2c3ed31c98afcba5e7ebdfc354cd4c02719044a","amp;dn":"Cloud+Control+%28Bliss+Release+%5BAlbum+2010%5D+%2B+Cloud+Control+%5BSelf+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d2c3ed31c98afcba5e7ebdfc354cd4c02719044a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,195,237,49,201,138,252,186,94,126,189,252,53,76,212,192,39,25,4,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
