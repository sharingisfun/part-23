This album features more songwriting collaborations between Petty and Mike Campbell than any other Petty album. It is notable for being the only studio album not represented on Petty's 1993 Greatest Hits album, even though the single &quot;Jammin' Me&quot; (co-written with fellow Traveling Wilbury Bob Dylan) was #1 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks for four weeks. In addition, this album was made to sound like a live recording, using a technique they borrowed from Dylan.\n\nTracks:\n1. Jammin' Me (Tom Petty, Bob Dylan, Mike Campbell) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:08\n2. Runaway Trains (Petty, Campbell) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:12\n3. The Damage You've Done (Petty) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:52\n4. It'll All Work Out (Petty) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:12\n5. My Life/Your World (Petty, Campbell) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:38\n6.

How Many More Days (Petty) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:16\n11.

I DID NOT do the rip. We did not have this in FLAC. Petty's discography [Studio only] is represented here: http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5669128/Tom_Petty_-_Studio_Discography_(Part_1_of_2)_[FLAC]_-_Kitlope. HOWEVER, even though the uploader listed &quot;Let me Up&quot; as included - it IS NOT! So, hence the rational for uploading this torrent.\n\n[NO image because even though I DID USE resize I still go this message: &quot;The image is too big, please use the resize function when uploading the image.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d38986a2b55cd0d6faf5a6d3890185cf54a8d69","amp;dn":"Tom+Petty+-+%5B1987%5D+Let+Me+Up+%28I%27ve+Had+Enough%29+FLAC%2FLOG%2FCUE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d38986a2b55cd0d6faf5a6d3890185cf54a8d69","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,56,152,106,43,85,205,13,111,175,90,109,56,144,24,92,245,74,141,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
