His journeys take him to some of the most remote and exciting places on earth - from the fantastic landscapes of western Tibet to the mountains of Georgia and the Caucasus; and from the plains of southern Iraq to the coasts of Ethiopia, Yemwn and the Horn of Africa. The stories he reveals will also take in Greece and Turkey, India and Nepal, and the world of Celtic Britain and the west of Ireland. In his investigations Michael Wood delves into the past to separate fact from fiction, and to find out the historical truth.\n\n\n\n\n                     In Search of Myths and Heroes-Episodes:\n                    -----------------------------------------\n\n\n1) The Search for Shangri-la - Michael explores the truth of the medieval Indian legend of a lost civilisation behind the western Himalayas - a place where the ancient wisdom of humanity was preserved to save it from our future. The legend was immortalised in James Hilton's novel about Shangri-la, and by Hollywood in Frank Capra's movie Lost Horizon. But why do such legends still captivate us today? And was there a real Shangri-la?\n\n 2) Jason and The Golden Fleece - Where does the ancient Greek legend of Jason's search for the Golden Fleece come from? The tale is the ultimate quest, older even than Homer's Iliad and Odyssey. But was there really an expedition beyond the limits of the known world back in the mists of prehistory, before the Trojan War? And why is the hero's quest one of the core human stories, from the first literature on earth, to the latest Hollywood epic?\n\n3) The Queen of Sheba - What lies behind the Bible story of the Queen of Sheba, King Solomon, and the Ark of the Covenant? The tale is found in both the Jewish Bible and the Muslim Koran, and the Queen of Sheba is still revered today in the sacred books of the Ethiopians, who claim her as the founder of their nation: but who was she? And why was the trade route from the Holy Land and Egypt to the Horn of Africa so important to the ancients?\n\n 4) Arthur: The Once and Future King - What was the Holy Grail? How did the search for this ultimate religious symbol come to be connected with Arthur, the once and future king? Was there a real Grail? A real King Arthur? And why does the quest for the Grail, still obsess us even today, from New Agers and mystics to Monty Python and Indiana Jones?\n\nEach journey opens up universal themes as Michael goes in search not only of the historical past and literal truth, but also of the mythic past and archetypal stories that reflect and have sustained human existence since the beginning of time.\n\nIllustrated with a wonderful series of specially commissioned photographs by the Himalayan author, photographer and mountaineer Steve Razzetti, In Search of Myths and Heroes is at once documentaries of great journeys, a historical adventure, and an exploration of some of humanity's most enduring myths. \n\n\n\nDirected by:  Jeremy Jeffs\n--------------------------\n\nWritten &amp; Presented by: Michael Wood\n------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\nTitle: In Search Of Myths And Heroes [4 Episodes] \nYear: 2005\nFile Size: 344 MB (Each) ----------------&gt;&gt;&gt;[1.34 GB All Episodes]\nFormat:AVI\nVideo Length: 00:58:58 &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; 00:59:09\nVideo Codec: XviD \nVideo Resolution: 480x272 \nVIdeo Bitrate: 813 kbit/s &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; 816 kbits \nFPS:  25.000000\nAudio Bitrate: 128 kbit/s\nAudio Codec: MPEG Layer-3\nChannels:  2\nSubtitles: (External English)\nParts: 4\n\n\n\n    EPISODES \n   ----------\n\n\n1) Shangri-La \n2) Jason And The Golden Fleece\n3) The Queen Of Sheba\n4) Arthur:The Once And Future King\n\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0862591/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0862591/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\nENJOY:\n\n\n\n\nYOUR CHOICE\n\nWTC-SWE\n\n\n\n\n\n(Please seed so others can enjoy)\n\n\n\nNote: External English subtitles included.\n-----------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor father information and pictures of all my torrents visit&quot; Suprbay Forum&quot; at   \n\nthis link: --------&gt; &lt;a href=&quot; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&lt;/a&gt;                 \n\n*** This information is also avaible on the &quot;nfo&quot; file that comes with all my uploads.)***   \n\n\nTips:For better background view change the &quot;Style Chooser&quot; at the bottom left \ncorner to &quot;graphite_x&quot;.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n***** HIGHLY RECOMMENDED DOWNLOAD *****\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:542773d2f15fc8ffb3ddce7f73a13014186d0a48","amp;dn":"In+Search+Of+Myths+And+Heroes-%28WTC-SWE%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"542773d2f15fc8ffb3ddce7f73a13014186d0a48","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,39,115,210,241,95,200,255,179,221,206,127,115,161,48,20,24,109,10,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
