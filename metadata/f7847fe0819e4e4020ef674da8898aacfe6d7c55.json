AVI's have become obsolete.  Good riddance. \n\nHowever, to support these and future downloads I ask YOU KEEP SEEDING after your download is complete.  I suggest you set a minimum UL speed of 30 kB/s by right clicking on the torrent in your Bittorrent client and adjusting the Bandwidth Allocation.  This will free up my bandwidth for new torrent uploads.  THANKS!\n\nI took DVD's of the TV show 24 and ripped H.264 MP4 files of each episode.  The files have a suffix of .m4v as they were ripped using HandBrake 0.9.4 with an Apple TV standard so they can be played on any current iPod, iPhone, iPad, Apple TV or in iTunes.  They can also be played on any compliant player but you may need to change the suffix from .m4v to .mp4.\n\nYou may notice the file sizes differ widely from episode to episode.\nHandBrake uses quality-based encoding. This means that instead of telling encoders to use a specific size and vary quality to meet it, we tell the encoder to vary size to meet a given quality level. Overall quality improves, since bits are spent only when they are needed, and are saved when they are not. While this means output size is somewhat unpredictable, the results in picture quality speak for themselves\n\nAdditional info:\nSampled Episode 9\nTotal bit rate: 1440 kbps\nFPS: 24.66\nVideo Dimensions 850 x 480\nAudio Channels: ACC and Stereo 48,000 kHz\n   \nThere are no subtitles or alternate languages.\n\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - \n24 - - Season 2  ..  SPOILERS AHEAD\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe season starts and ends at: 8:00 a.m. (LA time); the first scene of the season occurs in Seoul, South Korea (midnight, Seoul time).\nThe first fifteen hours deal with finding and disposing of the nuclear bomb. After the bomb is disposed of safely, the story focuses on the United States' response to the thwarted attack, and in particular the nation's retaliation against the people responsible for planning it. A recorded conversation between a terrorist involved with the bomb and high-ranking officials of three Middle Eastern countries (which are never specified) is used to implicate those countries in the plot. However, due to Jack Bauer's doubts, Palmer is reluctant to order military action against them until he has absolute proof that the recording is genuine. A majority of his Cabinet then vote to relieve Palmer of his position as President under Section 4 of the Twenty-fifth Amendment, believing his hesitation to be a sign of indecision and weakness, and is therefore indicative of his inability to lead the country effectively. The vice president, James Prescott, is elevated to the presidency and orders military strikes against the three countries to continue.\n\nJack, Michelle and Tony race to find the evidence that the recording is a forgery, resulting in the discovery that a group of European and American businessmen fabricated it in order to wage war with the Middle East, and planned to benefit from rocketing oil prices caused by the conflict. Once the evidence is produced, the strikes are called off and Palmer is reinstated as President, thanks largely to his ex-wife Sherry Palmer (who risks her life for the evidence, and who also had an indirect hand in the day's events). The eight cabinet members and Vice President tender their resignations (Palmer does not accept them), and Palmer then tells his staff that he believes that the strictest evidence of hostile intent is required before waging war. The President does however, relieve his Chief of Staff Mike Novick, who did not support him until the eleventh hour, despite being his most trusted confidante.\n\nLike in Season One, Season Two ends with a surprise twist. The nuclear bomb situation is resolved without massive loss of life, but President Palmer collapses after giving a speech, having been attacked with a biological weapon by Mandy in an assassination attempt. Viewers were forced to wait until the third season to see whether Palmer survived the attack. The sudden shift from a nuclear to biological threat also foreshadows the third season, which initially centers on the threat of an engineered virus being set loose on the public.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\nEpisode list:\n\nSeason 2, Episode 1: Day 2: 8:00 a.m.-9:00 a.m.\nOriginal Air DateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½29 October 2002\nRetired federal agent Jack Bauer is pulled back into field work after CTU learns of an impending nuclear attack in Los Angeles.\n\nSeason 2, Episode 2: Day 2: 9:00 a.m.-10:00 a.m.\nOriginal Air DateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½5 November 2002\nJack goes undercover to find Joseph Wald, where he learns that CTU is going to be bombed.
