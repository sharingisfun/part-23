Goliath\n2. Haunt of Roulette Dares\n3. Cygnus... Vismund Cygnus\n4. Viscera Eyes\n5. Wax Simulacra\n6. Drunkships of Lanterns\n7. Vermicide\n8. Tetragrammaton\n9. Meccamputechture\n10. Day of the Baphomets\n\nSetlength: 114 minutes.\n\n\nThe original source was probably stereo-out from the soundboard. The work done on the sound is mainly EQ-ing and limiting, the sound quality going from decent to pretty good.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:72cae60be623d864c2e6cbff6069f9e451bdfaad","amp;dn":"The+Mars+Volta%2C+Live+at+the+Troubadour%2C+LA%2C+2007+%28SBD-remaster%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"72cae60be623d864c2e6cbff6069f9e451bdfaad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,202,230,11,230,35,216,100,194,230,203,255,96,105,249,228,81,189,250,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
