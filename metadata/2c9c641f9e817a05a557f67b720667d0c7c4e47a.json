Very progressive music for the time, the sound is big, the arrangements bluesy, and Cleveland's powerful vocals alternate between rough-hewn and soaringly handsome. The live recording captures many of the shouts and cries of a superenthusiastic church audience. The backing choir is energized and booming, the funky organ just makes you want to jump up out of your chair, and Cleveland's preaching is simple, smart, and to the point. The only drawback is the crudeness of the recording, but surely the low fidelity is overcome by the performance's sheer power. &quot;[Jesus] can save you tonight until your hands look new,&quot; Cleveland preaches. &quot;Glory to God!&quot; \n--Mike McGonigal\n\n01.
