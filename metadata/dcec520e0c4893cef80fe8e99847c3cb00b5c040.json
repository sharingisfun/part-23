Zappa stated that along with Lumpy Gravy, this album was one of his finest achievements. The album features Ike Willis as the voice of &quot;Joe&quot;, a stereotypical garage band youth who unwittingly journeys through the miasma of the music business. Zappa provides the voice of the &quot;Central Scrutinizer&quot; characterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½a mechanical voice which narrates the story and haunts Joe's psyche with McCarthyistic 50s-era discouragement and &quot;scrutiny.&quot;\n\nThe album was originally issued in two parts, the first part being a single LP of Act I, and the second part being a double-LP set of Acts II &amp; III. All three acts were later issued together as a box set, and on compact disc as a double-CD. The major themes of the story include groupie migration, mockery of Scientology, appliance fetishism, garage bands, and above all censorship of music as an artform (eerily predicting the formation of the PMRC).\n\nJoe's Garage is particularly noteworthy for its extensive use of Zappa's xenochrony technique, in which guitar solos from older, completely unrelated recordings were extracted and overdubbed onto new songs. With the exception of &quot;Watermelon in Easter Hay&quot; and &quot;Crew Slut&quot;, all Zappa's solos on the album were constructed in this way.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dcec520e0c4893cef80fe8e99847c3cb00b5c040","amp;dn":"Frank+Zappa+-+Joe%5C%27s+Garage","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dcec520e0c4893cef80fe8e99847c3cb00b5c040","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,236,82,14,12,72,147,206,248,15,232,233,152,71,195,203,0,181,192,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
