Larry Daley who manages the night exhibit because the exhibits come to life because of the Tablet of Ahkmenrah, is in charge of the presentation. But when the exhibits go wild, Larry finds himself in trouble. He learns that the Tablet is corroding so he does some research and learns that Cecil, the former museum guard was at the site when the Tablet was discovered. He tells Larry that they were warned that if they remove it could mean the end. Larry realizes it means the end of magic. He talks to Ahkmenrah who says that he doesn't know anything. Only his father the Pharoah knows the Tablet's secrets. He learns that the Pharoah was sent to the London museum. So he convinces, Dr. McPhee the museum curator to help send him to London. He goes and takes Ahkmenrah with him but some of the others like Teddy Roosevelt, Attila, Octavius, and Jedediah come with him.\n\nRelease Info:\n\nRelease Name: Night at the Museum - Secret of the Tomb 2014 720p\nFormat: Mkv (Matroska)\nSize: 479 MiB\nVideo: H.265 HEVC | 1280 x 694 | 23.976 FPS | 1.85:1\nAudio: English | 223 Kbps | 5.1 ch | ACC\nRuntime: 1h 37mn\n\nScreenshots:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/cUvfd7f.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/cUvfd7f.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/mQwHs0P.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/mQwHs0P.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/tEX0NxQ.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/tEX0NxQ.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nDont be shocked by the small size !
