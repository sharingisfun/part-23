Thomas' Calculus 13th and Thomas' Calculus ET 13th both have the same problem set as they both cover the exact same topics, only a little differently as the book titles suggest (problem numbering in each version is different for this reason). In the regular version of calculus, transcendental functions (LOG, EXP, ARC) are covered in a separate chapter *after* the derivative and integration concepts have been introduced. In the early transcendentals (ET) version, transcendental functions are treated along with regular functions as the derivative and integration concepts are being developed. Students in an engineering or physics program need the calculus handling of these special functions concurrently in some other courses of their semester curriculum, so they study them earlier than students in health or administrative sciences.\n\n12th EDITION c2010 AVAILABILITY: (recommended files are files I used)\n\n* regular version solutions ISM (the most complete), 35.65 MB\n - direct download from 4shared (file: thomas calculus 12th solutions.pdf)\n - direct download from mediafire, filefactory (file: Thomas Calculus 12th [Solutions Manual] .pdf)\n - torrent : copy-paste this hash code F0F38E665F66BDD7965EE4FB2AB99108A9016491 at torrentproject.se\n\n* regular version textbook (the only one fully bookmarked and paginated), 341 MB:\n - direct download from 4shared (file: Thomas_Calculus_Single_Multi_12th_txtbk.pdf)\n - direct download when you load gulfupDOTcom/?cZ9rPe in browser (DOT = . ; file: idem)\n - torrent : google this hash code A6824BFF2B4E8B0FBF42EA6A02A3D978C6D56A4D\n\n* early transcendentals version textbook, 18 MB:\n - direct download: fiercely DMCAed and filename used as decoy by scammers (surveys, passworded files)\n - direct download: from dropbox (file: Thomas Calculus Early Transcendentals 12th Edition txtbk.pdf)\n - torrent : copy-paste this hash code 1BF52B83453BF3E0631098A0F854A28B5A292C3D at torrentproject.se\n - torrent : see the copy dumped anonymously here at TPB (exact duplicate)\n\n\n***  W A R N I N G  ***\n\nMake sure you understand the perils and pitfalls of using full solutions manuals like this one.\nSee: &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10954563/Calculus_Early_Transcendental_Functions_6th_Larson_solutions_ISM&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10954563/Calculus_Early_Transcendental_Functions_6th_Larson_solutions_ISM&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f6ce547771f123e81644d328ba45658cdc9abf6","amp;dn":"Thomas+Calculus+Early+Transcendentals+13th+c2014+solutions+ISM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f6ce547771f123e81644d328ba45658cdc9abf6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,108,229,71,119,31,18,62,129,100,77,50,139,164,86,88,205,201,171,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
