The first edition was published in 1965. It is largely a revision of the American Standard Version of 1901, with reference made to various texts in the original languages. It is designed to &quot;amplify&quot; the text by using a system of punctuation and other typographical features to bring out all shades of meaning present in the original texts.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f1d8344468405e835b2ff37eacf2ae58c972937","amp;dn":"The+Amplified+Bible+AMP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f1d8344468405e835b2ff37eacf2ae58c972937","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,29,131,68,70,132,5,232,53,178,255,55,234,207,42,229,140,151,41,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
