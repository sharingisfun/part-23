The title refers to the Answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything.\n\nThe story was originally outlined by Adams as Doctor Who and the Krikketmen to be a Tom Baker Doctor Who television six-part story, but was rejected by the BBC. It was later considered as a plotline for the second series of the Hitchhiker's TV series, which was never commissioned.\n\nA radio adaptation of Life, the Universe and Everything was recorded in 2003 under the guidance of Dirk Maggs, starring the surviving members of the cast of the original Hitchhiker's radio series. Adams himself, at his own suggestion, makes a cameo appearance; due to his death before production began on the series, this was achieved by sampling his character's dialogue from an audio book of the novel read by Adams that was published in the 1990s. The radio adaptation debuted on BBC Radio 4 in September 2004.\n\n=====================================================================================\n\nI put this together because I am a huge fan of Douglas Adams and the Hitchhikers &quot;trilogy&quot; but I could never find a propper rip of these audiobooks. Sure, there's plenty of rips in shitty, lossy mp3, but who the fuck wants that? FLAC gives you full loseless audio, and when you have audio books which are narrated by Stephen Fry and Martin Freeman, why would you want anything else?\nSo I bought all 5 audiobooks on cd, ripped each disc using Exact Audio Copy, logs and scans are included. Enjoy!\n\nAll I ask in return is that you #KeepSeeding! \n\n==========================================================================\n\nThousands of candles can be lit from a single candle, and the life of the candle will not be shortened. Happiness never decreases by being shared. ~Siddhartha\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:19e805f069b2c959934b5b68ac9030c401f9e431","amp;dn":"Life%2C+The+Universe+And+Everything+%5B2006%5D+%5BFLAC%5D+%5BEAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"19e805f069b2c959934b5b68ac9030c401f9e431","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,232,5,240,105,178,201,89,147,75,91,104,172,144,48,196,1,249,228,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
