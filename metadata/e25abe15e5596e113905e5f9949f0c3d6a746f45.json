Since 1853, its staff has selflessly brought its readers the cream of rural life, be it pheasant shooting, dry-fly fishing or the distinct merits of Cheval Blanc. If you love fieldsports, guns that can fire a spud 130 yards and very foxy friends at hunt balls, The FieldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s for you. If you donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t, well, heigh-ho.\n\n[/color][/b]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e25abe15e5596e113905e5f9949f0c3d6a746f45","amp;dn":"The+Field+-+December+2010-Mantesh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e25abe15e5596e113905e5f9949f0c3d6a746f45","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,90,190,21,229,89,110,17,57,5,229,249,148,159,12,61,106,116,111,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
