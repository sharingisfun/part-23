(EDIT: Ah crap, just broke the 1gb mark, oh well, it was updating low bitrate files to higher ones.)\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nWARNING: Lewis Black swears, talks about sex and such, and may scare small children. \nParental advisory is... um... advised?\n\nContents list (It's a bit long):\n\n(2008) Anticipation\n(2006) The Carnegie Hall Performance\n(2006) Nothing's Sacred.mp3 (x101 files [sorry])\n(2005) Luther Burbank Performing Arts Center Blues\n(2003) Rules Of Enragement\n(2002) Revolver\n(2002) The End Of The Universe\n(2000) Comedy Central Presents|Indecision 2000\nplus some more CCP stuff\n(2000) The White Album\n\nBack In Black|The Daily Show (New Year 1998).mp3\nBack In Black|Lewis Black on Why People Get Fat.mp3\nBack In Black|Lewis Black on Xmas (Rant).mp3\nBack In Black|Lewis Black on Airport Security.mp3\nBack In Black|Lewis Black on Pulling a Truck With Your Penis.mp3\nBack In Black|Lewis Black on Sexual Relations.mp3\nBack In Black|Lewis Black on Soccer (Rant).mp3\nBack In Black|Lewis Black on Stunts.mp3\nBack In Black|Lewis Black on Video Games.mp3\n\nLaughing Out Loud With Jim Norton\nLaughing Out Loud with Sue Costello\n\nUnknown Album|Bill Clinton.mp3\nUnknown Album|Candy Corn.mp3\nUnknown Album|Drug Traffic, Me.mp3\nUnknown Album|Dumbest Thing You've Ever Heard.mp3\nUnknown Album|H.Ross, Jessy V.

It's the reason why I'm not zipping it up, because I usually stop seeding and delete after I unzip it to another location, (f u scene &quot;rules&quot;) but I seed everything I download to at least 4+ ratio. \nPlease, SEED if you like it, maybe even seed if you don't, just be nicer compared to all the dead torrents on TPB.\n\nI was looking around TPB for some good Lewis Black, even if I had purchased the \naudio book. It's a pretty good listen, but I would rather hear a comic be a comic, \nrather than him reading his own book to me.\nThe thing is, the audio book is passworded on the torrents that have them, or you \nhave to sign up for an Audible account. (I used to have a paying account, but they \njust don't have the books I really cared for.)\n\nI have compiled alot of his stuff into one, all the while editing the mp3 information, so it didn't feel dirty when messing around with the files.\n\nI know there's the whole &quot;scene&quot; release rules, but their .mp3 names are so ugly, I don't care, I like my files all cleanly named, and I hate not being able to edit the files I'm seeding, so I cleaned them up, because I know I am not the only one that *HATES* official *Ye Olde Scene* naming rituals.\n\nStatic radio sound really bothers me, especially when it grows louder as the people \ntalk, so I attempted to clean up the O&amp;A Jail interview. \n(Why not make it sound like it's on AOL more, right? That's a little less annoying, \nand I only had to work around with the beginning to the middle abouts.)\nThank you AUDACITY!\n\nThe audio book is cut up into 101 little pieces here, but at least it isn't coded to not play without paying, right?\n\nIf there are repeats, I am sorry, but I tried to kill them all off, if I could.\n\n\nI have a version of the audiobook that is in about 10 pieces *or something like that*.\nIt isn't quite as crystal clear as the small tracks in this torrent, (but you could merge these ones together if you really wanted that, right?)\nIf you guys want me to upload that, tell me in the comments of this one.\n\n\nUL by: djTeka\n\n(And if you have a problem with the way I name it, you should do it yourself, k?)\n(Like the way the scene likes me to quit sharing just to rename them to something non-fugly)\n\nThanks to Audacity and Mp3tag v2.41!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4697658b780b5184a8bb4f51e50c31013eb2fb1e","amp;dn":"Lots+of+Lewis+Black%2B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4697658b780b5184a8bb4f51e50c31013eb2fb1e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,151,101,139,120,11,81,132,168,187,79,81,229,12,49,1,62,178,251,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
