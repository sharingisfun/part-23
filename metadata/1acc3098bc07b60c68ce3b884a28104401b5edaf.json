Next is &quot;Change&quot;, which is a great break-up song (from personal experience), followed by the anti-drug anthem &quot;You&quot;. &quot;Far-behind&quot; is a classic whose lyrics are many times taken for granted. &quot;Arrow&quot; is a flat out rocker with heavy guitars. &quot;Rain&quot;, all 6:58 min, shows the bands musical range, that includes a funky-groove complimented by Martin's singing style and some screeching guitar solos. The CD wraps up perfectly with two amazing acoustic songs, &quot;Cover Me&quot; and &quot;He Calls Home&quot;. &quot;Cover Me&quot; starts off with a great\nacoustic riff and then totally explodes into the chorus. &quot;He Calls Home&quot; is a bit softer with a circling chorus. Just when you think the song is over, Kevin Martin's voice soars for one more minute to wrap up the album.\n\nWe rip the descriptions from sites like cduniverse, allmusic and amazon.\nHHI presents no opinion on the artists work; only the quality of the rip. :)\n\nTrack Listing....:\n01.Don't you                                            [03:13]\n02.Change                                               [06:24]\n03.You                                                  [04:56]\n04.No sense                                             [04:49]\n05.Far behind                                           [05:00]\n06.Blossom                                              [04:31]\n07.Arrow                                                [03:14]\n08.Rain                                                 [06:59]\n09.Mothers dream                                        [04:31]\n10.Cover me                                             [04:46]\n11.He calls home                                        [05:03]\n____\n\n53:26 min\n 86,1 MB\n\nGREETS\n\nEveryone that has supported us over the years.
