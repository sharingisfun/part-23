Parts of the story may have been derived from the capture and death of Jane McCrea in July 1777 near Fort Edward, New York, by members of an Algonquian tribe.\n    (Summary from Wikipedia)\n\n\n\n\nPLEASE VISIT: www.opencast.de (Audibooks, ebooks permanently updated)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:247f97a58eec309b58f2fac21ec7a1060a48cd4f","amp;dn":"Audiobook+-+The+Last+of+the+Mohicans+by+James+Fenimore+Cooper","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"247f97a58eec309b58f2fac21ec7a1060a48cd4f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,127,151,165,142,236,48,155,88,242,250,194,30,199,161,6,10,72,205,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
