Footprints peaked at number nine on the albums chart, selling over 100,000 copies and being certified Gold.\nIn Valance's home country of Australia, success was similar. Footprints reached the top fifteen, sold over 35,000 copies, and was later certified Gold. All three of its singles also reached the top 3 on the singles chart.\nFootprints was also successful in Japan, where the album reached number nineteen on the Oricon albums chart and sold 159,606 copies. It was later certified Gold and became one of the big international successes of the year in that country.\n&quot;Kiss Kiss&quot; was the first single released by Valance. The single was released in April 2002 and went straight to #1 on the UK and Australian charts. &quot;Down Boy&quot; was the second single, released two months after Valance's debut single &quot;Kiss Kiss&quot;. It became a smash hit on the day of its release. &quot;Naughty Girl&quot; was the third and final single from the album, becoming a Top 3 hit in Australia and Top 20 single in the UK. Six months later, a fourth and final single, &quot;Tuck Your Shirt In&quot;, was announced; however, the single was cancelled due to poor sales of the previous single, and Valance was beginning to record her second album, State of Mind.\n\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Kiss Kiss\n[02] Tuck Your Shirt In\n[03] Down Boy (Radio Edit)\n[04] City Ain't Big Enough\n[05] Cocktails &amp; Parties\n[06] Whoop\n[07] Hush Now\n[08] All In The Mind\n[09] Harder They Come\n[10] Help Me Help You\n[11] Naughty Girl\n[12] Connect\n[13] Send My Best\n\nMusic Videos\n\n[01] Kiss Kiss\n[02] Down Boy\n\n\nTotal FLAC Play Time\t&gt; 00h:42m:02s\nTotal File Size\t&gt; 450mb (Including FLACs, Videos, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nMusic File Format\t&gt; FLAC [Exact Audio Copy]\nScanned Artwork\t&gt; Yes @ 300dpi\nOriginal CD Rip\t&gt; Yes - only1joe\nOriginal Uploader\t&gt; Yes - only1joe \nInternet Upload Speed\t&gt; 40-50KB/s\nMusic Genre\t&gt; Pop\nOriginally Released\t&gt; 14 October 2002\nRecord Company-&gt; London Records\n\n\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n* * * I Will Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents * * *\n* * * This Is A Multi-Tracker Torrent Check Your Bit Torrent Client For A True Number Of Seeds * * *\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cfcaa89dd21f6fea81a0770f2e623f9e490fa0ea","amp;dn":"Holly+Valance+-+Footprints+%5B2002%5D+%5Bonly1joe%5D+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cfcaa89dd21f6fea81a0770f2e623f9e490fa0ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,202,168,157,210,31,111,234,129,160,119,15,46,98,63,158,73,15,160,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
