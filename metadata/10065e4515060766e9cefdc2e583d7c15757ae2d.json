A modern classic about a penniless, unemployed young writer, the book paints an unforgettable portrait of a man driven to the edge of self-destruction by forces beyond his control. Required reading in world literature courses, the highly influential, landmark novel will also find a wide audience among lovers of books that probe the &quot;unexplored crannies in the human soul&quot; (George Egerton)\n\nPlease seed.
