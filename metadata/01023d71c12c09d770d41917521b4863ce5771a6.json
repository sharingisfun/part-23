This should greatly improve the process. See Note *\nAdded - Feature to save the XDVDFS structure to a comma delimited text file (mostly for research)\nAdded - XDVDFS File system entry details (if a read error is in the file system area)\nAdded - Feature that if user selects to fill read errors with zeros, but a \n\tread error occurs in file system data they will get prompted again as this \n\tcould be a media defect error in game data and shouldn't just be filled with zeros.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n* This uses a technique I called the &quot;Sector Mapper&quot; It uses the XDVDFS to read only the \n  data referenced by the file system.  In theory this should do two things:\n  \t1. Speed up the process by not trying to read the Security Place Holders\n  \t2. Speed up the process by only reading the data, not the entire disk.\n  Please be aware that although this has been tested and is working the concept has\n  not proven itself on a large scale.  It currently does not work on Xbox 360 disks.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  \nXbox Backup Creator v2.0 Build:0100 by Redline99\n\tInitial Release\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHardware Requirements:\n\tProcessor: Something within the last 3 years should be fine. I use a P4 3GHz with 1GB Ram\n\tRam:       The application currently used a 20MB write buffer, shouldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t be a \n\t\t   problem on current machines.\n\tDrives:\t   A DVD+R Double Layer burner that supports a Buffer Underrun Technology.\n\t\t   PC DVD Samsung SH-D162C with Kreons modified firmware (PC DVD Drive)**\n\t\t   Xbox 360 Samsung TS-H943A with Xtreme compatible firmware, v1, v2 or v3.\n\t\t   Xbox 360 Hitachi GDR-3120L with Xtreme compatible firmware with OPA v2.1***\n\nOS Requirements:\n\tWindows NT platform with NTFS file system (because file sizes are 4+ GB)\n\tWindows XP SP2 is preferred, Vista has not been tested.\n\tIf there is enough interest I may support Win9x by way of creating file sets \n\twithin FAT32 limits. An ASPI driver will also be required. (ASPI already supported)\n\t\nApplication Use:\n\tIt should be pretty straight forward. Read your disk then write it to a blank DVD+R DL.\n\tSince this application is not multi-threaded, please do not disturb it while writing.\n\t\n\tAfter inserting a disk it may take a few seconds for it to be recognized. If it does\n\tnot populate and enable the buttons after more than 30 seconds press \n\tCTRL-R to force\ta refresh.\n\t\n\tRemember, you must use one of the supported drives for READING Xbox disks.  The drive\n\twill ALSO need the modified firmware. :)  A lot of people were confused about this. \n\tYou cannot just pop the Xbox disk into your burner to make a backup.\n\t\n\tThis app doesn't support making a backup of a backup. Find another way, its easy. \n\t\n\tIf your burner doesn't automatically set the book type to DVD-ROM for DVD+R DL then\n\tyou must set the booktype before writing using the appropriate bitsetting app for \n\tyour burner.  Some of the newer Xbox drive firmwares get past this requirement.\n\t\tSamsung - Use Xtreme v3.1 or later\n\t\tHitachi - Use the MediaCheck patch by Geremia\n\t\nKnown Issues or Errors:\n\tIf your disk isn't recongized with in 20 seconds, press CTRL-R to force a refresh\n\t\n\tMay have display issues with some locale settings, not really tested.\n\t\n\tWriting doesn't support all burners, I hope that it has improved though!\n\t\n\tSession Fixation Errors are usually due to media and/or burner firmware.\n\t\n\tOptimum Power Calibration failures are usually due to low quality media.\n\n\tInvalid Write Address failures are usually due to low quality media.\n\n\tYou may get a DeviceIoControl error with a Sense error of &quot;0/00/00&quot;, I don't have a good \n\tanswer but, some people have reported success by reinstalling updated Sata drivers. Also\n\tanother method that may work is to use the Nero ASPI driver instead of SPTI.\n\t\n\tDuring the write initialization you may encounter &quot;Power On, or Bus Device Reset occurred&quot;\n\tI have not been able to figure out the root of this or the proper method of recovery.\n\tIf you happen to know, please fill me in on the secret. :)\n\t\nSupported Backup Images:\n\tXtreme style disk images version 1-3. wxRipper support may be added at a later date.\n\tThe application will only build version 3 style images. I don't see the need to add \n\tthe complication of the version 1,2 types. This is because the data is outside \n\tthe readable LBA range to the Xbox and the older firmwares will just not use the extra \n\tDMI and PFI sectors. The Security Sector is in the same position across versions. \n\t\nXbox Versions:\n\tXbox 360: Xbox 360 disks and Xbox One disks!\n\tXbox One: Not supported, previous version was making the ISO incorrectly\n\t          and I haven't had time to fix yet. Hopefully next major release.\n\t\nSupport:\n\tI will do my best to keep current and add requested features, feel free to contact \n\tme with ideas, compatibility issues or bug reports.  I ask of you to please not use \n\tthe forums to talk about your adventures in pirating.  Specifically the forums at\n\twww.xboxhacker.net and www.xbox-scene.com.  My personal belief is that making a\n\tbackup of property you purchased is within your rights.  Of course not everyone shares\n\tthis opinion and you should use common sense and do not distribute or download backup\n\tdisk images.  You can view Microsoft's statement on piracy at the link below.\n\t &lt;a href=&quot;\thttp://www.microsoft.com/piracy/default.mspx&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\thttp://www.microsoft.com/piracy/default.mspx&lt;/a&gt;\n\nInstallation:\n\tThis application requires the Visual Basic 6 sp6 runtimes, included if you need them\n\tThese is also a dependency on MSCOMCTL.OCX, included in the msi setup package.\n\tHopefully you can just run the exe! Use the Setup Package if you need it.\n\tIf you are upgrading from a previous version, you should be able to just copy\n\tthe executable and run it.\n\tIf you decide to run the installer, uninstall the previous through Add/Remove Programs.\n\t\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSome shortcut keys:\n\tCTRL-TAB = Switch to next tab\n\tCTRL-L   = Show/Hide Log\n\tCTRL-C   = Cancel current operation\n\tCTRL-R   = Refresh Disk Information\n\t\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n   * Provided you do it my way and your hardware is compatible! :)\n\n  ** Pre Version .80 of Kreon's Samsung SH-D162C doesn't completely support the Security Sector \n     extraction, but the application will detect the capability when it is available.\n     By the way... Good job Kreon! \n     \n     Also note that .80 has a bug that prevents the SS from working on a Xbox One. You can manually\n     fix it or better yet use Kreon's .81 version.\n     \n *** Currently, the Hitachi GRD-3120L is not capable of viewing the game partition without \n     a hardcoded firmware patch. Hopefully someone will create proper support for unlocking.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:01023d71c12c09d770d41917521b4863ce5771a6","amp;dn":"Xbox+Backup+Creator+v2.9+Build%3A0306","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"01023d71c12c09d770d41917521b4863ce5771a6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,2,61,113,193,44,9,215,112,212,25,23,82,27,72,99,206,87,113,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
