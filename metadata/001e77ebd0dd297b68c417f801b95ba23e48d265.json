Eventually they parted with their record label, focusing on performing live for a number of years, before signing with the independent Ovation label in 1977. Their first single for the label, a cover of the Kitty Wells hit &quot;Making Believe&quot;, charted only making the Top 80 (possibly due to competition from Emmylou Harris' cover of &quot;Making Believe&quot;, which hit the U.S. country charts around the same time). However, it was their second single, a &quot;cheating&quot; song called &quot;Heaven's Just a Sin Away&quot;, that proved to be their breakthrough. The song topped the country charts and was also a minor crossover pop hit, and won the 1978 Grammy for Best Country Vocal by a Duo or Group. Subsequent hits included &quot;Just Like Real People&quot;, &quot;It Don't Feel Like Sinnin' to Me&quot;, &quot;Sweet Desire&quot;, &quot;You'd Make an Angel Want to Cheat&quot;, and a cover of Dolly Parton's &quot;Put it Off Until Tomorrow&quot;.  In 1981, after Ovation Records closed their doors, the duo signed with Mercury Records, and continued to have hits with the Top 10's &quot;Teach Me To Cheat&quot; and &quot;If You're Waitin' On Me (You're Backin' Up)&quot;. More hits followed with &quot;Movin' Train&quot; and &quot;Precious Love&quot; which made the Top 20.\nTheir last top ten hit, &quot;Thank God for the Radio&quot;, which came in 1984, was also their last number 1 country hit. Their last Top 20's would come in 1984 and 1985 with &quot;My Baby's Gone&quot; and &quot;I'll Dance Every Dance With You&quot; respectively. In 1986, they signed with MCA Records where they scored three mid-level hits that year. In 1987, they signed with Step One Records where they scored several minor hits. In 1989, they signed with Epic Records where their last chart single, &quot;Blue, Blue Day&quot; made the Top 70. They did continue to tour and perform and released several CDs up until Royce Kendall's death from a stroke he suffered in 1998.\n   \n\n\nTwo Divided By Love\n\nCBR 160\nTracklist\n\n01-Two Divided By Love\n02-Big Silver Jet\n03-Easy To Love\n04-We Can Make It\n05-Can't Make It Under City Lights\n06-Everything I Own\n07-Never Ending Song Of Love\n08-The Right To Say I'm Sorry\n09-Make Me Your Kind Of Woman","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:001e77ebd0dd297b68c417f801b95ba23e48d265","amp;dn":"The+Kendalls-Two+Divided+By+Love","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"001e77ebd0dd297b68c417f801b95ba23e48d265","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,30,119,235,208,221,41,123,104,196,23,248,1,185,91,162,62,72,210,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
