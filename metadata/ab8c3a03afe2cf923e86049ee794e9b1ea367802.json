It is a tribute to the cinematographer as well as Shaun Davey. When I listen to the CD, the magnificent Irish landscape comes back alive in my mind every time I play it, which is almost daily. The CD ranges from traditional upbeat Irish folk to more mellow meditative music. Note: this is mostly an acoustic album, but if you liked the music and want to remember the mood you felt when you left the theatre ( If you are a fan of this movie, you know what I mean ) then short of popping the DVD into a large screen surround sound home theatre, this is the next best thing.[/quote]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab8c3a03afe2cf923e86049ee794e9b1ea367802","amp;dn":"Waking+Ned+Devine+-+Motion+Picture+Soundtrack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab8c3a03afe2cf923e86049ee794e9b1ea367802","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,140,58,3,175,226,207,146,62,134,4,158,231,148,233,177,234,54,120,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
