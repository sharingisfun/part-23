Release: 1994. 320Kbps.\n\n\nThese nine CD's bring our Hank Snow anthology up to 1984, which marked 50 years of recording. The emphasis here is on Hank's recordings from the 1970s, when he once again returned to making pure, back-to-basics country music. The hits included Hello Love, I'm Still Moving On, Come The Morning, and many others. Once again, the albums were well thought-out and executed, and include such gems as 'The Jimmie Rodgers Story', 'Cure For The Blues', 'Grand Ole Opry Favorites', 'All About Trains', 'Tracks And Trains', 'Instrumentally Yours' and his rare New Zealand album, 'Now Is The Hour.' This box also includes his duets with Kelly Foxton and Willie Nelson.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b5740c4b01527dbd43ae7dcea59679bf5734f430","amp;dn":"Hank+Snow+-+The+Singing+Ranger+Vol.+4+%5B1969-1984%5D+9CD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b5740c4b01527dbd43ae7dcea59679bf5734f430","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,116,12,75,1,82,125,189,67,174,125,206,165,150,121,191,87,52,244,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
