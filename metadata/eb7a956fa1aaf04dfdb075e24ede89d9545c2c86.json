All in all it's a pretty good alternative to the 7.9GB full DVD copy that's floating around.\n\nNote that Disk 1 is the instructional part and Disk 2 is mostly just drum solos. You only need to download what you want!\n\nVideo:\n1086 Kbps XVID AVI\n29.97 fps \n512*384 (4:3)\n\nAudio:\nEnglish\n128 Kbps VBR MP3\n48000 Hz\n2 channels","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb7a956fa1aaf04dfdb075e24ede89d9545c2c86","amp;dn":"Flo+Mounier+Extreme+Metal+Drumming+101+DVD+Rip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb7a956fa1aaf04dfdb075e24ede89d9545c2c86","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,122,149,111,161,170,240,77,253,176,117,226,78,222,137,217,84,92,44,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
