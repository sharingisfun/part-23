The album is now available on iTunes, and also streaming on Spotify. After the release of the 2010 EP, &quot;About Ghosts,&quot; the band spent time holed up, honing its sound and figuring out exactly what kind of band it is.\n\n The new album is self-produced, but features mixing from Ikey Owens (keyboardist for Jack White, and former member of prog-rock band Mars Volta). Lafayette musician/engineer Tony Daigle put the finishing mastering touches on the album. The result is a consistently epic album that nods as much to the new school of rock, like Sparta or Wolfmother, as it does to rock heroes, like Alice in Chains or Black Sabbath.\n\n&quot;Moralies&quot; is a fuzzed out that lets the guitar riffs do most of the talking. &quot;Everyone of Them&quot; features a tribal groove before breaking into the well-known rock territory and another great solo. (As you can tell, I don't mind good guitar rock or solos.) &quot;Ablyss&quot; is the album where they figured out just who they are what they wanted they music to convey. &quot;We had at least 20 songs, and we ended up cutting things out, trying to make a more cohesive album,&quot; Comeaux said. &quot;We wanted this to be an album, rather than just a collection of songs.&quot; With this one in the can, they're excited to see what comes next. They can't say for sure what might happen in the coming years, but they're excited. &quot;We've gotten to the point now where we've over the learning curve,&quot; King said. &quot;We're over the growing pains.&quot;\n\nMatthew Sigur is a reporter for the Daily Advertiser and Times of Acadiana.
