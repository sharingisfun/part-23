The latter rose from the former, although the two are now so estranged that to reunite them would be an act of savage madness. Imagine a gaggle of modern hack-n-slash roleplayers who had somehow never been exposed to the original Tolkien mythos, and then imagine taking those players and trying to introduce them to Tolkien via a D&amp;D campaign.\nÃ¢â‚¬â€ The Blurb for the first strip\n\nAccording to this comic, The Lord of the Rings wouldn't make a good Dungeons &amp; Dragons campaign.\n\nThink about it. Loads of Backstory, few battles, limited treasure (even if you aren't expecting a Monty Haul campaign), and lots and lots of talking (since many events are told to others after the fact).\n\nTo a player whose rules are Play The Game Skip The Story and RPGs Equal Combat, this would make for a frustrating game. But it makes a great comic.\n\nPS: Sorry for the previous release, it had a mistake in it, so I deleted it.\n\nFor more Shamus Young you can click the link included in the torrent or go straight to http://shamusyoung.com/\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\nPS: If you want to request a comic, please make a post here: https://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=51\nand add as title something like [scanlation] title_of_comic.\nIt makes it easier for me to keep track of requests :P\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\nNote:\n\nIf you never read E-comics before, you should download a program like ComicRack, (you can find that here: http://www.softpedia.com/get/Multimedia/Graphic/Graphic-Viewers/ComicRack.shtml).\nThen, you can use &quot;.cbr files and open them with ComicRack.\nIt's easy to use, and has a great quality!\n\nHope you enjoy!\t\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFor other comics, you can check my release thread:         &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=112889.&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=112889.&lt;/a&gt;\nHere the most recent versions of the torrents will be referenced.
