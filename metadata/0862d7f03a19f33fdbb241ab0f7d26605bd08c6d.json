All scanning credit goes to original scanners. I did, however, edit issues 7-8 to remove ads that for some reason had been left in by the scanner. I changed picture numbering accordingly. This collection is complete AS OF JULY 11 2008, but issue 12 will be coming soon and it\\\\\\&amp;#039;s going to be big as the end of Grant Morrison and Frank Quitely\\\\\\&amp;#039;s run on the series.\n\nAs always with comics, if you like it, buy it. These writers, artists, colorists, and all the talented people that create this for you need to get paid for their hard work!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0862d7f03a19f33fdbb241ab0f7d26605bd08c6d","amp;dn":"All-Star+Superman+1-11+%28No+Ads%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0862d7f03a19f33fdbb241ab0f7d26605bd08c6d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,98,215,240,58,25,243,63,219,178,65,171,15,125,38,96,91,208,140,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
