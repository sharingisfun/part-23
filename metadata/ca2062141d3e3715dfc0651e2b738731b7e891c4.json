I do not encode many films that have not been released on blu-ray, but every once in a while, there's a film shocking or controversial or good enough that I'll do it even though it may only be 576p or 480p. This is one of those special films. In order to compensate as much as possible for the source not being blu-ray, I encoded using a TESA (transformative-exhaustive) motion estimation method and a CRF setting of 18, which is the maximum recommended for non-HD sources. Considering the source and x264 settings I used, I don't think it's possible to have a higher quality encode than this, at least using current technology. The CRF setting of 18 resulted in a video bit rate of 2248kbps for the feature and 4373kbps for the bonus footage (interview with director Matthias Glasner.) The interview with the director is in English and has a 4:3 aspect ratio as opposed to the 16:9 aspect ratio of the film. The feature is in German, although English subtitles are included with an external .srt file. I also included the German trailer along with the director's interview in the Extras folder, although the trailer is in German without any English subs. \n\nBitrates listed are variable, using CRF encoding (setting: 18) for maximum quality, which means the numbers you see are average bitrates.\n\nPlease seed as long as possible, preferably until reaching a share ratio of at least 3:1.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca2062141d3e3715dfc0651e2b738731b7e891c4","amp;dn":"Der+Freie+Wille+%282006%29+%5B576p%5D+x264+-+Jalucian","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca2062141d3e3715dfc0651e2b738731b7e891c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,32,98,20,29,62,55,21,223,192,101,30,43,115,135,49,183,232,145,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
