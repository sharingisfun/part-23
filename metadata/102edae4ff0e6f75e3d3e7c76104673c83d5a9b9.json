In 1986, Cash found himself without a record label when Columbia Records decided not to pick up the option on his contract after close to 30 years. Within a year the Man in Black had a new deal with Mercury Records, but like many veteran country acts in the &amp;#039;80s, radio wasn&amp;#039;t especially interested in him and Cash&amp;#039;s recordings of the period are a frustrating mix of re-recordings of his old hits, and new material pockmarked by overly slick production and engineering that didn&amp;#039;t flatter Cash&amp;#039;s voice or musical approach. The spirit was still willing within Cash, but he wasn&amp;#039;t getting much help, and this collection of material from his brief sojourn with Mercury is often dispiriting stuff. Six of the tunes here were drawn from 1987&amp;#039;s Classic Cash, in which Johnny recut 20 of his best-known tunes in honor of his entry into the Country Music Hall of Fame; the new versions of numbers like &quot;I Walk the Line,&quot; &quot;Guess Things Happen That Way,&quot; &quot;Ring of Fire,&quot; and &quot;Cry Cry Cry&quot; are approached in a lean, straightforward fashion, and while Cash handles them like a pro, he doesn&amp;#039;t sound especially excited, and the new recordings don&amp;#039;t hold a candle to the originals. (Cash also redid some older numbers on his other Mercury sessions, several of which are also included here.) Elsewhere, the selections from Cash&amp;#039;s other Mercury albums ? Johnny Cash Is Coming to Town, Boom Chicka Boom, Water from the Wells of Home, and The Mystery of Life ? tend to reflect their flaws instead of their strengths, though there are a few bright moments, including the nostalgic but rollicking &quot;The Night Hank Williams Came to Town&quot; and the apocalyptic &quot;Goin&amp;#039; by the Book.&quot; The fact that the disc is bookended by two songs that didn&amp;#039;t even appear on Cash&amp;#039;s Mercury recordings is telling ? the set leads off with &quot;Highwayman,&quot; a single from his collaboration with Waylon Jennings, Kris Kristofferson, and Willie Nelson, and ends with U2&amp;#039;s &quot;The Wanderer,&quot; with Cash&amp;#039;s guest lead vocal giving the song a gravity it sorely needs. As an overview of Cash&amp;#039;s years with Mercury, this disc is serviceable but little more. The Definitive Collection? Not by a long shot. \n\n\nJohnny Cash - The Definitive Collection\n\n\nRip Info\n--------\n\nArtist: Johnny Cash\nAlbum Title: The Definitive Collection\nRecord Label: Mercury Records\nRip Date: 2008-03-04\nCatalog Number:\nGenre: Country\nYear: 2008\nSource: CD\nEncoder: LAME 3.97 -V2 --vbr-new\nQuality: 192 kbps avg / 44.1KHz / Joint Stereo\n\n\nTrack List\n----------\n\n01 Johnny Cash with Willie Nelson, Waylon         3:04\n   Jennings &amp; Kris Kristofferson - Highwayman\n02 Johnny Cash - Sixteen Tons                     2:45\n03 Johnny Cash with Waylon Jennings - The Night   3:23\n   Hank Williams Came To Town\n04 Johnny Cash - Get Rhythm                       2:32\n05 Johnny Cash - Long Black Veil                  3:15\n06 Johnny Cash - Ring Of Fire                     2:44\n07 Johnny Cash - Guess Things Happen That Way     1:45\n08 Johnny Cash - I Walk The Line                  2:33\n09 Johnny Cash - Cry Cry Cry                      2:25\n10 Johnny Cash with Emmylou Harris - As Long As   3:01\n   I Live\n11 Johnny Cash with Roseanne Cash &amp; The Everly    2:47\n   Brothers - Ballad Of A Teenage Queen\n12 Johnny Cash with June Carter &amp; The Carter      2:57\n   Family - Where Did We Go Right\n13 Johnny Cash with Hank Williams Jr. - That Old  2:51\n   Wheel\n14 Johnny Cash - Cats In The Cradle               3:17\n15 Johnny Cash - Family Bible                     2:48\n16 Johnny Cash - Hey Porter                       2:19\n17 Johnny Cash - Goin&amp;#039; By The Book                3:20\n18 Johnny Cash - Wanted Man                       2:53\n19 Johnny Cash with U2 - The Wanderer             4:43\n                                                --------\n                                                00:55:22\n                                                79.98 megs\n\nRip Notes\n---------\n\nFeatures An Amazing Litany of Guest Stars: U2; Hank Williams, Jr.; Willie\nNelson; Waylon Jennings; Rosanne Cash; Emmylou Harris, and June Carter.
