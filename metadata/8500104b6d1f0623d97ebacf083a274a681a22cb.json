E Linderholm that uses advanced mathematical methods to prove results normally shown by elementary means. Although the aim is largely satirical, it also shows the non-trivial mathematics behind operations normally considered obvious, such as numbering, counting, and factoring integers.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8500104b6d1f0623d97ebacf083a274a681a22cb","amp;dn":"Mathematics+made+difficult+-+Carl+E.+Linderholm","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8500104b6d1f0623d97ebacf083a274a681a22cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,0,16,75,109,31,6,35,217,126,186,207,8,58,39,74,104,26,34,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
