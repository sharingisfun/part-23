As soon as another copy action happens, the earlier clip vanishes. There is a whole genre of these programs that let you do more than one clipping and manage them. This one is one such program. Super Copy Paste lets you collect a few clips. When you want to paste, the interface presents all the clips. You select one and paste it. This has a simple interface and is quite intuitive. Most users would be able to get productive very quickly. The controls are also well laid out. The controls are intuitive so that most users will be able to figure out what to do and how to do it. There can be a large number of clips. The clips are shown as paragraphs which can be a little ambiguous at times. A tabular format would have been better.\n\nThe clipboard can manage only textual material. That is another shortcoming. Most recent products let you clip images and paste them as easily as the text clips. You can copy several clips one after another, they will get saved. Once the display is open, you can do only paste actions. Copy action is as you would expect, CTRL+C. Though the features offered work well, the number of features offered are very limited really. This product thus gets just a 2 star rating.\n\nPublisher's description:\nSuper Copy Paste - Save every copy action (CTRL+C) you do. Restore your past copy actions (CTRL+C) anytime.
