It looks beyond advertising as a        \n    medium that simply sells products, and beyond analyses of gender that    \n    focus on biological difference or issues of objectification and          \n    beauty, to provide a clear-eyed view of the two-tiered terrain of        \n    identity and power relations.                                            \n                                                                             \n    With its sustained focus on how our perceptions of what it means to      \n    be a man or a woman get reproduced and reinforced on the level of        \n    culture in our everyday lives, The Codes of Gender is certain to         \n    inspire discussion and debate across a range of disciplines.             \n                                                                             \n                                                                        \n                                                                    \n                                                         \n                           \n        \n              Currently looking for:             \n        \n                                                       \n                                                        \n                                                                       \n                                                                           \n               Do you feel ripped off by what you get in                    \n                exchange for your supply?
