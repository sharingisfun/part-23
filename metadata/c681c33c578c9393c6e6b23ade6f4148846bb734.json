Any comments or tips for future uploads are welcome.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c681c33c578c9393c6e6b23ade6f4148846bb734","amp;dn":"Sweatshop+Union+-+Local+604++%28Cue%2BScans%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c681c33c578c9393c6e6b23ade6f4148846bb734","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,129,195,60,87,140,147,147,198,230,178,58,222,111,65,72,132,107,183,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
