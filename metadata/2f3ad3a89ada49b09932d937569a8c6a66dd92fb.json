Players can play as the alien Meccaryns, the ethereal Sea Reapers, or the giant Kabuto, who each strive for their objectives in their own ways. The PS2 drops the multiplayer component of the PC version in favor of an enhanced single-player mode, with streamlined controls and a bit more emphasis on action. Strategy is still an important component of this game however, and the wacky humor of the PC title remains as well.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f3ad3a89ada49b09932d937569a8c6a66dd92fb","amp;dn":"Giants%3A+Citizen+Kabuto+%5BPS2%5D+%5BPAL%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f3ad3a89ada49b09932d937569a8c6a66dd92fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,58,211,168,154,218,73,176,153,50,217,55,86,154,140,106,102,221,146,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
