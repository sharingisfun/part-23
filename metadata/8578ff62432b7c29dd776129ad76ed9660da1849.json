The Halifax-based pop singer/songwriter sounds positively peppy on her third album, which is full of charming melodies, playful arrangements and electro-tinged dance beats that leave her folk roots in the dust.\n\nGrant seems to be writing with an audience in mind, a departure from the introspective broken-heartedness displayed on 2009ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Echoes. She adds some grit to her overwhelmingly pretty vocals on How I Met You, a horn-punctuated Motown chorus to All Year ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ just one of the albumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s many standout choruses ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and sinister synths on Walk Away that prevent a saccharine overdose and suggest an entirely new direction.\n\nThe ability to pull off such fearless variety ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ softer, intimate folk also makes appearances ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ is a sure sign of a songwriter who has come into her own.\n\ncd ripped by EAC \n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/about/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8578ff62432b7c29dd776129ad76ed9660da1849","amp;dn":"Jenn+Grant...Honeymoon+Punch%282011%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8578ff62432b7c29dd776129ad76ed9660da1849","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,120,255,98,67,43,124,41,221,119,97,41,173,118,237,150,96,218,24,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
