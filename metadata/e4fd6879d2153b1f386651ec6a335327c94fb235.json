Named Tarzan by the great apes that raise him, he must learn the law of the jungle to survive. As he matures, his strength and agility develop to match those of the beasts by whom he is surrounded, yet he realizes he is different. He combines higher intelligence, superhuman strength, and his jungle training to become the unconquerable Lord of the Jungle! But when a group of civilized people invade his paradise, his life is changed forever, for with them is Jane, the first woman Tarzan has ever seen. Now he must have her as his own! How can this uncivilized ape-man hope to win her?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e4fd6879d2153b1f386651ec6a335327c94fb235","amp;dn":"Tarzan+of+the+Apes+-+by+Edgar+Rice+Burroughs+%288CDs+unabr%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e4fd6879d2153b1f386651ec6a335327c94fb235","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,253,104,121,210,21,59,31,56,102,81,236,106,51,83,39,201,79,178,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
