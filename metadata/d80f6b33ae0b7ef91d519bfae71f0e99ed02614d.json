No one can question his tenacity when it comes to his business model, his race car driving or his attempt to circumnavigate the globe in a hot-air balloon. He is also known to be a bit stubborn at times.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d80f6b33ae0b7ef91d519bfae71f0e99ed02614d","amp;dn":"+My+Next+Step%3A+An+Extraordinary+Journey+of+Healing+and+Hope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d80f6b33ae0b7ef91d519bfae71f0e99ed02614d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,15,107,51,174,11,126,249,29,81,155,250,231,31,14,153,237,2,97,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
