In fact, their equipment is usually simple, their chemicals household products, and their education basic. Most of the time the elements at the scene are perfectly legal to sell and own. It is only in the combination of all these elements that the lab becomes the scene of a criminal operation.\n\nForensic Investigation of Clandestine Laboratories guides you, step-by-step, through the process of recognizing these illegal manufacturing operations. Then it shows you how to prove it in the courtroom. In non-technical language this book details:\n\nHow to recognize a clandestine lab\nHow to process the site of a clandestine lab\nHow to analyze evidence in the examination laboratory\nWhat to derive from the physical evidence\nHow to present the evidence in court\n\nThe identification and investigation of a clandestine lab, and the successful prosecution of the perpetrators, is a team effort. A collaboration of law enforcement, forensic experts, scientists, and criminal prosecutors is required to present a case that definitively demonstrates how a group of items with legitimate uses are being used to manufacture an illegal controlled substance. Providing an understanding of how the pieces of the clandestine lab puzzle fit together, this book outlines the steps needed to identify and shut down these operations, as well as successfully prosecute the perpetrators.\nProduct Details\n\n    * Hardcover: 392 pages\n    * Publisher: CRC Press; 1 edition (July 28, 2003)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 0849312272\n    * ISBN-13: 978-0849312274","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bea7b344e28972ae304a44ac8046b4fe58f90711","amp;dn":"Forensic+Investigation+of+Clandestine+Laboratories%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bea7b344e28972ae304a44ac8046b4fe58f90711","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,167,179,68,226,137,114,174,48,74,68,172,128,70,180,254,88,249,7,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
