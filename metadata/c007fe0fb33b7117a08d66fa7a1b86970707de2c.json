It was released on October 23, 2001 by Suge Knight. It was re-released on March 20, 2006.\n\nAmazon.com Review By Dalton Higgins - Chuck D of Public Enemy once prophesized that if artists didn't own their masters (tapes), the masters will own the artists. Well, hip-hop's fave gangster CEO Suge Knight owns most of his former high-profile label mates' master tapes and continues to issue collections of dated works by Tha Dogg Pound, Dr. Dre, and now Snoop. Originally entitled Dead Man Walking to scare the willies out of Snoop, this release comes with a big fat greasy caveat emptor. Sure, this is a ghetto fab collection of the Doggfather's finest pre-No Limit and Doggystyle Records moments dating back to his brilliant cover of Biz Markie's &quot;Vapors&quot; on Tha Doggfather album. That said, Snoop wants nothing to do with this release because he won't receive any proceeds from it and has urged his fans not to buy it. Contractual shenanigans aside, this release is off the hook and contains most of Snoop's finest career headbangers, from &quot;Gin and Juice&quot; to &quot;Who Am I (What's My Name).&quot; A great purchase if you can live with your conscience.\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Nuthin' But A G Thang\t---&gt; Dr. Dre Featuring Snoop Dogg\n[02] Head Doctor\t---&gt; Featuring Swoop G\n[03] Gin &amp; Juice\n[04] Eastside Party\t---&gt; Featuring Nate Dogg\n[05] Murder Was The Case\t---&gt; (Remix)\n[06] Ain't No Fun (If The Homies Can't Have None)\t---&gt; Featuring Nate Dogg, Warren G &amp; Kurupt\n[07] Doggfather\t---&gt; (Remix)\n[08] Midnight Love\t---&gt; Featuring Daz Dillinger, Raphael Saadiq\n[09] Eastside\n[10] Who Am I (What's My Name)?\n[11] Doggy Dogg World\t---&gt; Featuring Tha Dogg Pound, Daz Dillinger, Raphael Saadiq\n[12] Too High (Poly High)\t---&gt; Featuring Big Pimpin' Delemond, Daz Dillinger\n[13] Vapors\n[14] Usual Suspects\t---&gt; Featuring Threat\n[15] Keep It Real\t---&gt; Featuring Bad Azz, Kurupt, Mack 10, Techniec, Threat\n[16] Snoop Bounce\t---&gt; Featuring Brad Wilk, Tim Bob Commerford, Tom Morello (Roc N Roll Remix)\n\nTotal FLAC Play Time\t&gt; 01h:13m:41s\nTotal File Size\t&gt; 517mb (Including FLAC, Art Covers &amp; File)\nMusic File Type\t&gt; IExact Audio Copy FLAC Level 8\nMusic Video Format\t&gt; N / A\nScanned Artwork\t&gt; Yes @ 300dpi\nOriginal CD Rip\t&gt; Yes - only1joe\nOriginal Uploader\t&gt; Yes - only1joe \nUpload Speed\t&gt; 33-35KB/s\nMusic Genre\t&gt; Hip Hop Rap\nRelease Date\t&gt; 22 October 2001\nRecord Company\t&gt; Death Row Records\nArtists WebSite\t&gt; http://www2.snoopdogg.com\n\t&gt;\n\t&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snoop_Dogg\n\t&gt; http://www.azlyrics.com/s/snoopdogg.html\n\t&gt;\n\t&gt; http://www.bebo.com/snoopdogg\n\t&gt;\n\t&gt; http://www.muzu.tv/snoopdogg\n\t&gt;\n\t&gt;[Who Am I (WhatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s My Name)\n\t&gt;[Doggy Dogg World]\n\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n* * * I Will Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents * * *\n* * * This Is A Multi-Tracker Torrent Check Your Bit Torrent Client For A True Number Of Seeds * * *\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c007fe0fb33b7117a08d66fa7a1b86970707de2c","amp;dn":"%5B2001%5D+Greatest+Hits+-+Snoop+Doggy+Dogg+517mb+FLAC+%5Bonly1joe%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c007fe0fb33b7117a08d66fa7a1b86970707de2c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,7,254,15,179,59,113,23,160,141,102,250,122,27,134,151,7,7,222,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
