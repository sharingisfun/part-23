Mellon, the American colossus who bestrode the worlds of industry, government, and philanthropy, leaving his transformative stamp on each.\n\nAndrew Mellon, one of AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s greatest financiers, built a legendary personal fortune from banking to oil to aluminum manufacture, tracking AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s course to global economic supremacy. As treasury secretary under Presidents Harding, Coolidge, and finally Hoover, Mellon made the federal government run like a businessÃ¢â‚¬â€œprefiguring the public official as CEO. He would be hailed as the architect of the Roaring Twenties, but, staying too long, would be blamed for the Great Depression, eventually to find himself a broken idol. Collecting art was his only nonprofessional gratification and his great gift to the American people, The National Gallery of Art, remains his most tangible legacy.
