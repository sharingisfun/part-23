If you're adding the torrent via magnet link, you can deselect any undesired file in the list of files once the torrent has begun downloading.\n========================================================\n\n\nThe Locke family's story began in 2007 in Welcome to Lovecraft, and after five years of tension and terror, there are only seven issues left to their story. The beginning of the end starts here. Dodge has the Omega key, and nothing can stop him from using it.\n\n\nThanks goes to theProletariat for this release.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3b9e308f7e67710aaf1f30449cc7b038cec31cab","amp;dn":"Locke+%26amp%3B+Key+-+Omega+01++%283+covers%29+%28theProletariat-Novus%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3b9e308f7e67710aaf1f30449cc7b038cec31cab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,158,48,143,126,103,113,10,175,31,48,68,156,199,176,56,206,195,28,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
