Released on June 17, 1997 through Capitol Records, it was the band's last studio album to feature drummer Nick Menza. His departure would mark the end of the band's longest lasting lineup to date, having recorded four studio albums. Megadeth decided to produce the record with Dann Huff in Nashville, Tennessee, because they were not satisfied with their previous producer, Max Norman. The album features 12 tracks with accessible song structures, specifically aimed for radio airplay. The lyrics were also altered, in order to make the music more inclusive for wider audience. These changes were met with mixed opinions from music critics, who noted the band moving away from their thrash metal roots.\n\nWARNING: This album was originally uploaded by the user Gael in the website www.identi.li, and I downloaded the file and reuploaded here in The Pirate Bay, and if you want to visit their profile, here is the link http://www.identi.li/index.php?action=profile;user=Gael\n\nTracklist:\n\n01-Trust\n02-Almost Honet\n03-Use The Man\n04-Mastermind\n05-The Disintegrators\n06-I'll Get Even\n07-Sin\n08-A Secret Place\n09-Have Cool, With Travel\n10-She-Wolf\n11-Vortex\n12-FFF (Fight For Freedom)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae9685e3e9d0ec63f3864687046cc45749a7c366","amp;dn":"Megadeth+-+Cryptic+Writings+%28NO+REMASTERED%29+%281997%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae9685e3e9d0ec63f3864687046cc45749a7c366","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,150,133,227,233,208,236,99,243,134,70,135,4,108,196,87,73,167,195,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
