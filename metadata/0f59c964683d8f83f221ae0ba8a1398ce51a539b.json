Kate Bosworth (Davis) is a sincere, demure girl and talented artist. Her twin sister Pat (also Davis) is a flamboyant, man-hungry manipulator. Orphans, the girls' guardian is their cousin, Freddie Lindley (Charles Ruggles), with whom Kate elects to spend a summer on Martha's Vineyard. There, she meets Bill Emerson (Glenn Ford), a handsome engineer spending a summer vacation as a lighthouse inspector. Kate falls deeply in love with Bill, but when Pat shows up, he goes for the more exciting sister, eventually marrying her. Devastated, Kate throws herself into her art, but she becomes discouraged under the tutelage of an abusive master, Karnock (Dane Clark). A sailing accident gives Kate the chance to take her sister's place -- but can she fool Bill into believing that this sweet, innocent woman is his philandering, scheming wife? A Stolen Life (1946), a remake of an earlier picture by the same name that had been produced by Paramount only seven years earlier starring Elisabeth Bergner in the twins role, was nominated for a Best Special Effects Oscar.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0038984/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0038984/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nExtra subtitles:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/sublanguageid-all/idmovie-26002&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/sublanguageid-all/idmovie-26002&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nDirector:\nCurtis Bernhardt\n\n\n\n\tBette Davis\t... \tKate Bosworth / Patricia Bosworth\n\n\tGlenn Ford\t... \tBill Emerson\n\tDane Clark\t... \tKarnock\n\n\tWalter Brennan\t... \tEben Folger\n\tCharles Ruggles\t... \tFreddie Linley (as Charlie Ruggles)\n\n\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 01:47:08\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 448x352\nCodec : XviD MPEG-4 codec\nFPS : 23,98\nBitRate : 779 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,21 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 48000 Hz\nBitRate : 135 Kbps\n\n\nEnjoy!Please Help Seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f59c964683d8f83f221ae0ba8a1398ce51a539b","amp;dn":"A+Stolen+Life+%281946%29++Bette+Davis%2C+Glenn+Ford","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f59c964683d8f83f221ae0ba8a1398ce51a539b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,89,201,100,104,61,143,131,242,33,174,11,168,161,57,140,229,26,83,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
