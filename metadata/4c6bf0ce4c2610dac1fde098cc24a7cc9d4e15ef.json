Its appearance resembles that of another classical audio player (Winamp), so youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll get used to it very quickly. It can also be customized with skins. The program includes a 18-band equalizer, a visualization window to display rhythmic visual effects and a playlist editor to organize your audio files. A nice fading effect makes your list of songs look like an endless music loop and a handy volume normalizing feature avoids drastic volume changes between tracks. Also, the playerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s main functions can be conveniently controlled by global hotkeys.
