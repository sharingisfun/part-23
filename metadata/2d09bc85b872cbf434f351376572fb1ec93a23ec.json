A young man falls in love with the older woman who accompanies his bride-to-be to an informal introduction. On their wedding night the bride, who has noticed his infatuation and all it's implications, suggests that they maintain their union on a platonic level. This would allow his love to remain pure and stop her betraying her friend, the older woman, whom she suspects to be in love with her husband as well. In the best Mizoguchi manner this is achingly beautiful, subdued and heart felt. The criticism of society is more hinted at than in other films. The experience on a whole is just as emotionally satisfying.\n\n   General\n      Complete name : Oyu-sama (Miss Oyu)-1951-Kenji Mizoguchi.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      Format/Family : RIFF\n      File size : 1.37 GiB\n      PlayTime : 1h 29mn\n      Bit rate : 2180 Kbps\n      StreamSize : 10.5 MiB\n   Video #0\n      Codec : DivX 5\n      Codec/Family : MPEG-4\n      Codec profile : Simple Profile/Level 1\n      Codec settings/PacketBitStream : No\n      Codec settings/BVOP : No\n      Codec settings/QPel : No\n      Codec settings/GMC : 0\n      Codec settings/Matrix : Default\n      PlayTime : 1h 29mn\n      Bit rate : 2046 Kbps\n      Width : 720 pixels\n      Height : 544 pixels\n      Display Aspect ratio : 4/3\n      Frame rate : 25.000 fps\n      Resolution : 8 bits\n      Chroma : 4:2:0\n      Interlacement : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.208\n      StreamSize : 1.28 GiB\n   Audio #1\n      Codec : MPEG-1 Audio layer 3\n      Codec profile : Joint stereo\n      Bit rate : 128 Kbps\n      Bit rate mode : CBR\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Sampling rate : 44 KHz\n      Resolution : 16 bits\n      Video0 delay : 26ms\n      StreamSize : 80.3 MiB\n      Writing library : Lame 3.96.1\n      Coherency/PlayTime : 12837\n\nJapanase audio, English, Spanish and Portuguese subtitles\n\nIMDB: tt0043892","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d09bc85b872cbf434f351376572fb1ec93a23ec","amp;dn":"Oyu-sama+%28Miss+Oyu%29-1951-Kenji+Mizoguchi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d09bc85b872cbf434f351376572fb1ec93a23ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,9,188,133,184,114,203,244,52,243,81,55,101,114,251,30,201,58,35,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
