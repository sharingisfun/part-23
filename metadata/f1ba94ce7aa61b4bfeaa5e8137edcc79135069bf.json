Written by Hattie Naylor; Full-cast dramatisation.\n\nA young girl emerges from a forest after a nameless war, knowing nothing of where she has come from or where she has been. She finds the local doctor, Charonne, trapped in the briar. After she has freed him he takes her back to his village, where everyone is jittery after the recent conflict, especially as thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s to be a tribunal, and rumour has it that some villagers will be strung up for war crimes. Only the doctor is unconcerned. All he cares about is telling his patient the tale of Sleeping Beauty, as heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s desperate for her to remember... but remember what?\n\nAnton ...... John Biddle\nIreena and Rosa ...... Laura Greenwood\nYoung Charonne ...... Harry McEntire\nCharonne ....... Tim McMullan\nSylvanne ....... Ruth Mitchell\nMarie .......
