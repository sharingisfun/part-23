The remnants of civilization survive underwater after a cataclysmic event decimates the earth. Warfare destroys the remaining dry land, and survivors are forced to eke out an existence beneath the sea, relying on technology to remain in the realm of the living. Azure hasn't come into contact with another human for seven years and believes herself to be alone Ã¢â‚¬â€ until a blip materializes on her radar.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:255604bfb3dd21009e7d9106fd3258dffcce26c0","amp;dn":"Azure+%5BComplete%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"255604bfb3dd21009e7d9106fd3258dffcce26c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,86,4,191,179,221,33,0,158,125,145,6,253,50,88,223,252,206,38,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
