About .:\n\nIf you&amp;#039;ve never played any Ratbag games and \nare looking for a solid racer with an unusual subject, \nDirt Track Racing 2 is well worth trying out.\n\nIn Dirt Track Racing 2, you&amp;#039;ll find something like a cross between \nrally racing and NASCAR racing. Like in NASCAR races, you&amp;#039;ll race \non closed, purpose-built tracks. Here, most of the 14 tracks are oval \nvariants with a few particularly dangerous figure-eight tracks thrown \nin for good measure. True to the game&amp;#039;s name, you&amp;#039;ll be racing across\nbumpy dirt surfaces, often wet ones, regularly sliding through the corners\nlike a seasoned rally racer.\n\n:. screenshots .: \n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.gamespot.com/pc/driving/dirttrackracing2/images.html?om_act=convert&amp;om_clk=tabs&amp;tag=tabs;images&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.gamespot.com/pc/driving/dirttrackracing2/images.html?om_act=convert&amp;om_clk=tabs&amp;tag=tabs;images&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n:.
