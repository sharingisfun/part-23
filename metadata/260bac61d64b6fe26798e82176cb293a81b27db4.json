It was a show\nyou either loved or hated.  I thought it was great which\nis why I looked all over for it once I got into torrents\nand the Usenet.  \n\nBelow are reviews from two commentators, both off the IMDB \nsite indicated above.  Please note there are some scene\nstealers in the second review so you might not want to\nread more than halfway down :-)\n\nIn what must have been one of the shortest lived series on \nnetwork television, &quot;Cop Rock&quot; was part &quot;Real Stories of the \nHighway Patrol&quot; and part &quot;Sound of Music&quot;. After chasing down \na criminal, the force would take to the street for an organized \ndance number, then haul the guy back to HQ. This may have been \nthe only series to have been based on a broadway musical format.  \n                 Written by Michael Silva &lt;&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;17647e7b61767a7357747b727839757439727362&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;&gt; \n                 \n                 \nThe 1990s started off with one of the boldest experiments ever \nattempted in American television # the creation of an hour-long \nweekly television police drama, done as a musical. Longtime \ntele-vision innovator Steven Bochco, creator of major hits like \nHill Street Blues and L.A. Law, took the biggest risk of his \ncareer. He brought the musical back to television but this time \nas a gritty, street-wise cop show called Cop Rock. The songs \nwere written by a stable of songwriters ably led by the Oscar-\nwinning Randy Newman. Half the critics thought it was the worst \nidea of the century; half thought it was pure genius. The \ntelevision drama had been moribund for some time and Bochco \ncreated something entirely new, powerful, interesting, fresh. \nNothing like it had ever been attempted before, and most \nimportantly, it was done well and done seriously. Its \ndetractors claimed it was unrealistic for cops and robbers to \nbreak into song, but none of them had complained quite this \nloudly about the various aliens that had appeared on the \nairwaves, about shipwrecked movie stars and millionaires, about \nbionic men and women, or about the rest of the lackluster crap \nfilling the TV schedule. As an example of its audacity, its \nfirst episode alone included a rap song delivered by junkies as \nthey're being arrested in a drug raid, a gospel number by a \njudge and jury convicting a drug dealer, a tender pop ballad by \na husband about his much younger wife, and an R&amp;B number by a \ncorrupt lady mayor to the man who's just offered her a bribe. \nBut the most powerful number came at the end of the episode. A \nyoung junkie sits on a bus stop bench singing a lullaby to her \ninfant daughter, a haunting Randy Newman song called &quot;Sandman&quot; \n(later re-used in Newman's Faust). As she finishes the song, a \nstation wagon pulls up, a man gets out and pays her $200 for \nthe baby. As he drives away with the baby, the junkie finishes \nthe lullaby and breaks down in tears as the music quietly ends \nand the camera pulls away. It was devastating. And it was \nbrilliant drama. Unfortunately, it cost $1.8 million an episode \n# a record at the time # and its ratings were consistently \ndismal. ABC tried to get Bochco to drop the musical numbers but \nhe refused, so they canceled the show after four months. Bochco \nlater told Entertainment Weekly that of all his shows, Cop Rock \nwas by far the most fun he had ever had making television. \nYears later, Cop Rock was partly redeemed as cable channel VH-1 \nrebroadcast the series and a new generation discovered its \nquirky brilliance.                                          \n                                    Written by &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;fe909b899d969f84c8cabe9f9192d09d9193&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:260bac61d64b6fe26798e82176cb293a81b27db4","amp;dn":"Cop+Rock+%281990%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"260bac61d64b6fe26798e82176cb293a81b27db4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,11,172,97,214,75,111,226,103,152,232,33,118,203,41,58,129,178,125,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
