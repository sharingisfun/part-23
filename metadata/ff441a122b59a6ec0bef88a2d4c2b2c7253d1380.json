In the U.S., it was released in 2001 together with Judas 0. The album&amp;#039;s concluding track, &quot;Untitled&quot;, was The Pumpkins&amp;#039; final recording before their breakup. Completed in the days leading up to the band&amp;#039;s farewell concert at the Metro in Chicago, it was also released as a single. Another notable track is &quot;Real Love&quot;; while previously released on Machina II/The Friends &amp; Enemies of Modern Music, this was taken from the factory master tapes and, as a result, lacks the pops and clicks inherent in all copies of Machina II (which is vinyl sourced).\n\n1. &quot;Siva&quot; ? 4:21\n2. &quot;Rhinoceros&quot; ? 5:53\n3. &quot;Drown&quot; ? 4:30\n4. &quot;Cherub Rock&quot; ? 4:59\n5. &quot;Today&quot; ? 3:22\n6. &quot;Disarm&quot; ? 3:18\n7. &quot;Bullet with Butterfly Wings&quot; ? 4:17\n8. &quot;1979&quot; ? 4:23\n9. &quot;Zero&quot; ? 2:41\n10. &quot;Tonight, Tonight&quot; ? 4:15\n11. &quot;Eye&quot; ? 4:54\n12. &quot;Ava Adore&quot; ? 4:21\n13. &quot;Perfect&quot; ? 3:22\n14. &quot;The Everlasting Gaze&quot; ? 4:02\n15. &quot;Stand Inside Your Love&quot; ? 4:13\n16. &quot;Try, Try, Try&quot; ? 5:09\n17. &quot;Real Love&quot; ? 4:10\n18. &quot;Untitled&quot; ? 3:51\n\n\nIncludes Album Cover and All Mp3s Are Tagged Correctly\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff441a122b59a6ec0bef88a2d4c2b2c7253d1380","amp;dn":"The+Smashing+Pumpkins+-+Rotten+Apples","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff441a122b59a6ec0bef88a2d4c2b2c7253d1380","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,68,26,18,43,89,166,236,11,239,136,162,212,194,178,199,37,61,19,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
