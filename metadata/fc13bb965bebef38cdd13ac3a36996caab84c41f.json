In 1992, his 'Peepshow' strips were serialized by Kitchen Sink Press under the title 'Peepshow - The Cartoon Diary of Joe Matt'. His work is now published by Canadian publishing house Drawn and Quarterly.\n\nJoe Matt's work on Peepshow is part of the autobiographical comics genre, kick-started by the confessional stories of Harvey Pekar and Robert Crumb. Along with these cartoonists, Joe Matt's work frequently involves soliloquies &quot;to camera&quot;. Peepshow is part of a self-referential universe that includes Matt's contemporaries Chester Brown and Seth, all of whom have included each other in their books.\n\nIn 2004, it was reported that HBO was developing an animated series based on Matt's comic &quot;The Poor Bastard&quot; a collection of stories within Peepshow numbers #1 to #6. The series would be produced my by Matt and David X. Cohen. However, Joe Matt later stated, &quot;Yes, HBO was interested in making a series based on The Poor Bastard, but they came to their senses and changed their mind. Please feel sorry for me and buy the book when it comes back into print in January 2007.&quot;\n\nThe most recent issue of Peepshow, #14, went on sale November 1, 2006. A collection featuring Peepshow #11-14 titled Spent was released in June 2007. Matt has stated that &quot;I'll soon be writing / drawing about L.A. for a book that most likely will not be released as single issues, but rather a self-contained book&quot;.\n\nFiles donated by thewickerman586","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc13bb965bebef38cdd13ac3a36996caab84c41f","amp;dn":"Joe+Matt+-+Peepshow","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc13bb965bebef38cdd13ac3a36996caab84c41f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,19,187,150,91,235,239,56,205,209,58,195,163,105,150,202,171,132,196,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
