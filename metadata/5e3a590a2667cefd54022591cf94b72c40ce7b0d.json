They had their first two hit singles, 'Seven Seas OfRhye' and 'Killer Queen,' released two albums, 'Queen II' and 'Sheer Heart Attack,' and completed major tours across the UK, America and Europe. In the UK, they performed three sold-out shows at the legendary Rainbow Theatre in London's Finsbury Park, one in March on the 'Queen II' tour and two in November following the release of 'Sheer Heart Attack'. To mark the 40th Anniversary of these shows, fans can finally enjoy Queen 'Live At The Rainbow 74', lovingly restored, re-edited, mixed and digitally mastered and including much previously unseen footage. The main show is from November with, as a bonus, the only surviving footage from the March show. This is Queen dazzling their audience with an unforgettable show delivered with a skill and confidence which belied their youth.\n\nTracklist:\n\nSheer Heart Attack Tour, Live at the Rainbow, November Ã¢â‚¬â„¢74\n\n01.
