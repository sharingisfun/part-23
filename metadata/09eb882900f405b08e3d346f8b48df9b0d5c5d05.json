Schow and John Shirley, and starring Brandon Lee in his final film appearance. Based on James O'Barr's 1989 comic book of the same name, it tells the story of Eric Draven (Lee), a rock musician who is revived from the dead to avenge his murder and that of his fiancÃƒÂ©e.\n\nLee was accidentally killed during filming. Unfinished scenes that were to feature him were dealt with by rewrites and digital special effects. The Crow was dedicated to him and his fiancÃƒÂ©e, Eliza.\n\nThe film opened at the top of the box office and was a critical and commercial success. It also achieved a strong cult status.\n\nBrandon Lee died of a gunshot wound on March 31, 1993 after an accidental shooting on set at EUE Screen Gems Studios in Wilmington, North Carolina.\n\nHe was rushed to the New Hanover Regional Medical Center in Wilmington, NC where he underwent 6 hours of surgery. However, attempts to save him were unsuccessful, and Lee was pronounced dead at 1:03pm on March 31, 1993 at the age of 28. The shooting was ruled an accident.\n\nAfter Lee's death, the producers were faced with the decision of whether or not to continue with the film. Sofia Shinas, who had witnessed the accident, did not want to continue and went home to Los Angeles. The rest of the cast and crew, except for Ernie Hudson, whose brother-in-law had just died, stayed in Wilmington. Paramount, who were initially interested in distributing The Crow theatrically (originally a direct-to-video feature), opted out of involvement due to delays in filming and some controversy over the violent content being inappropriate given Lee's death. However, Miramax picked it up with the intention of releasing it in theatres and injected a further $8 million to complete the production, taking its budget to approximately $23 million.The cast and crew then took a break for script rewrites of the flashback scenes that had yet to be completed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:09eb882900f405b08e3d346f8b48df9b0d5c5d05","amp;dn":"The+Crow+%5B1994%5D+Brandon+Lee+-+Film+%26amp%3B+Bonus+Disc","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"09eb882900f405b08e3d346f8b48df9b0d5c5d05","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,235,136,41,0,244,5,176,142,61,52,111,139,72,223,155,13,92,93,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
