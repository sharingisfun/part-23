The Observer declared Woodpigeon a Ã¢â‚¬Å“Best New DiscoveryÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in June of this year, while CanadaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Post City Magazine called HamiltonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s September Toronto performance Ã¢â‚¬Å“awe-inspiringÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, and the Saatchi Gallery awarded Woodpigeon the Ã¢â‚¬Å“New Talent AwardÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ at their inaugural Ã¢â‚¬ËœGlittering PrizesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ that month.\n\nWoodpigeon continues to refine and expand upon his sound with Ã¢â‚¬ËœThumbtacks &amp; GlueÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, recorded in Calgary, Alberta with producer Arran Fisher and mastered by Ryan Morey. Known for his stunning and heart-wrenching orchestral pop, Ã¢â‚¬ËœThumbtacks &amp; GlueÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ shows off Hamilton at his most diverse, from Ã¢â‚¬ËœChildren Should Be Seen And Not HeardÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ crunching guitar and Ã¢â‚¬ËœAs Read In The Pine Bluff CommercialÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ pure pop to the delicacy of Ã¢â‚¬ËœLittle WingsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and the bitter sting of Ã¢â‚¬ËœRobin SongÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. This is the sound of a songwriter hitting his stride.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7dc7a4032432d5b7c3f243e5701da4d7e8d34f14","amp;dn":"Woodpigeon+-+Thumbtacks+and+Glue+%5B2013%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7dc7a4032432d5b7c3f243e5701da4d7e8d34f14","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,199,164,3,36,50,213,183,195,242,67,229,112,29,164,215,232,211,79,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
