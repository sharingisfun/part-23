Referencing bands from Fugazi to Jawbreaker to Buffalo Tom, the band consisted of singer/bassist Josh English, drummer Will Bartlett, and bassist James Bransford. After a debut single for Hydrahead, the band fell in with the Some label and recorded 1997's Self-Made Mess at Dave &quot;the Snake&quot; Sabo's (Skid Row) New Jersey studio. Heartbreak's Got Backbeat followed two years later, and the band's final record, American't (Or Won't), was released in 2001 on Big Wheel Recreation. As the band progressed, their sound slickened and softened and English's vocals became less throaty.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e044e2d072371894735b260797b7f04c9f7e0e18","amp;dn":"Six+Going+On+Seven+-+Heartbreak%27s+Got+Backbeat+%281999%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e044e2d072371894735b260797b7f04c9f7e0e18","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,68,226,208,114,55,24,148,115,91,38,7,151,183,240,76,159,126,14,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
