Who is Ghost Rider!?? Discover the answer. A combination of the Highest Voted, (By Hundreds of fans through forums, online votes and well known Ghost Rider experts) Most Necessary (Origin of Heroes, Villains, and Story Elements) with Marvel's Personal Favorites (As illustrated previously in there own compilation)\r\n\r\nSo I'm back with the original vengeful, tormented marvel man. Is he crazy, is he smarter than the rest? Maybe he's both. Ha! The best thing I discovered in doing this &quot;Who is&quot; is the aspect or characterization that the general public can get wrong. For instance you could find that the insane gun wielding manic down the street is simply misunderstood . . . Or not!! I don't want to ruin anything put I was pleasantly surprise with these stories. I hope you have as much fun reading as I did making it","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6139a3fbdc08271f994f85aa9eaaffef354dd3e7","amp;dn":"Who+Is+The+Punisher","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6139a3fbdc08271f994f85aa9eaaffef354dd3e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,57,163,251,220,8,39,31,153,79,133,170,158,170,255,239,53,77,211,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
