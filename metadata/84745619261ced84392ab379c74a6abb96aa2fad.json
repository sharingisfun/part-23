The first model came out in 1987 followed one year later by a CD extension that made the PC-Engine the first console to have CD games.\r\n\r\nThis was quite an impressive machine, with good graphic capacities (16-bit video processor, 512 colors, 64 sprites) and a fast and powerful 8-bit CPU. It also had a very good game collection, with unique and high quality games. And even today some PC-Engine games are still without an equivalent on modern consoles. Of course if you only enjoy 3-D games, well, the PC-Engine may disappoint you a bit, but if you love good old 2-D games, especially shoot'em up, give it a try, it really has some excellent games!\r\n\r\nBut we are sure that you already know all that. \r\n\r\nGo find those PC-Engine CD-ROMs that you stored in a cupboard a few years ago, remove the dust on them, and go downloading MagicEngine!\r\n\r\nMagicEngine emulates the PC-Engine almost perfectly. The emulator has:\r\n\r\nfull HuCard emulation!\r\nfull SuperGrafx emulation!\r\nfull CD-ROM and Super CD-ROM emulation!\r\n(with a custom System Card - no BIOS ROM needed)\r\nfull Arcade Card emulation!\r\nvery accurate and fast emulation!\r\ngame save/load feature!\r\nnice and easy to use graphical user interface!\r\nfive players mode - fully configurable!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:84745619261ced84392ab379c74a6abb96aa2fad","amp;dn":"Magic+Engine+1.0+Fully+Registered+for+Windows","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"84745619261ced84392ab379c74a6abb96aa2fad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,116,86,25,38,28,237,132,57,42,179,121,199,74,106,187,150,170,47,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
