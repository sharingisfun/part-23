Maxim De Winter (Charles Dance) marries a woman half his age (Emilia Fox) only a year after his first wife, the beautiful and accomplished Rebecca, dies. She finds herself in an aristocratic social world her middle class upbringing did not prepare her for, and housekeeper Mrs Danvers (Diana Rigg, in an Emmy-winning performance) despises her for taking her darling Rebecca's place. But these are not the only problems to face.\n\nThis 1997 update to the original 1940 Hitchcock thriller from the story by Daphne Du Maurier should be included in everyone's video library. This is the\nfavorite version in our houshold, and possibly has a more convincing ending than the original.\n\nA closed caption file, Rebeccca.txt, is included for brave souls willing to try thier hand at subtitle writing.\n\nAlso another text file is included with comments taken from the IMBd listing.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d79b2138bae73767f83396e2c3948fc1dddb4ab9","amp;dn":"Rebecca+%281997%29+TV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d79b2138bae73767f83396e2c3948fc1dddb4ab9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,155,33,56,186,231,55,103,248,51,150,226,195,148,143,193,221,219,74,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
