As the name suggests, it was the first to feature his now-famous &quot;first great quintet&quot; ( though in fact they had recorded a session for Columbia Records three weeks earlier, eventually released on the album 'Round About Midnight ). The album is often known as Miles, since that is the only word on the cover.  As with the other albums recorded for Prestige the following year, the quintet was playing familiar material in a fairly straightforward manner.
