There is another report that Nakano record shop, a Japanese local specialty store of Krautrock, released two psychedelic albums from the independent label Voice Records and after a short while went bankrupt because of their debt by these releases and promotions. Anyhow there is no information except the fact Brast Burn could release their one and only album Debon in 1975 (or in late 1974) and an uncertain report Brast Burn might be a solo project by Michiro Sakurai, a Japanese unknown artist. (By the way, the other album released by Nakano record shop is Alomoni 1985 by KARUNA KHYAL, and some claim Michiro Sakurai of Brast Burn and Yoshihiro Takahashi of KARUNA KHYAL should be the identical person.)
