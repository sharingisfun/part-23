For the past few years they  \nhave been lifting dance floors and souls all over the world for the past few  \nyears being sure that there is no way how to not recognize their music.      \nThis album is the music they speak and that comes from inside Ananda Shake&amp;#039;s  \nsound.                                                                        \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:95fdcfd9e1b4417db67335d0b798bff42396d097","amp;dn":"%5BPSYCHEDELIC%5DAnanda_Shake_-_Inside_The_Sound-2007.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"95fdcfd9e1b4417db67335d0b798bff42396d097","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,253,207,217,225,180,65,125,182,115,53,208,183,152,191,244,35,150,208,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
