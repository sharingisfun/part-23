This book is all about saving time. Busy web developers should not have to plow through pages of theory or history only to discover that no practical applications are provided, nor should they have to read a paragraph five times to extract some meaning from it. All of the techniques within this book are explained using fully worked examples that you can immediately apply to your own projects.\n\nWith each technique the book provides:\n-&gt; A practical and useful example (and a screen shot of the end result where applicable).\n-&gt; The markup for a fully worked example.\n-&gt; A downloadable template to adapt for use in your own websites.\n\nWith Practical HTML5 Projects, you can dive straight into the book at the required chapter and immediately find answers to your website problems, and find the sample code you can use to get it right. Start creating websites using the practical examples, summaries, and templates. \n\nThis book includes topics such as rollover navigation menus without scripts, adding audio and video, rounded corners, drop shadows, adding PayPal services, and much more. It also includes sections on troubleshooting and transitioning to HTML5 and CSS3 to help bring your existing content up to date.\n\nWhat youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn\n-&gt; Discover new techniques for creating interesting, attractive and accessible websites\n-&gt; Save time spent researching poorly documented techniques\n-&gt; Avoid lengthy trial-and-error testing and hours spent reading single topic manuals\n-&gt; Download templates and quickly adapt them for your own use\n-&gt; Keep pace with the latest developments and recommendations in web design\n-&gt; Accumulate a useful tool kit of resources and templates\n\n\nWho this book is for\nPractical HTML5 Projects acknowledges the fact that designers, teachers, and students would rather produce something than spend hours researching how to produce it.
