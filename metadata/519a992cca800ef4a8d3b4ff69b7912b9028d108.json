Throughout their career, the band has been subject to much controversy among Christian listeners, over their lyrical themes and personal lifestyles. The members of Showbread have labeled their musical sound as &quot;Raw Rock&quot;. According to former guitarist Matt Davis, the band's name comes from &quot;a biblical reference that Jesus used to show how Christianity isn't so much about rules but about love.&quot;\n\nGod Bless,\nTorrentTracts - July 2012\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:519a992cca800ef4a8d3b4ff69b7912b9028d108","amp;dn":"Showbread+Discography+1999-2010+%289+Releases%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"519a992cca800ef4a8d3b4ff69b7912b9028d108","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,154,153,44,202,128,14,244,168,211,180,255,105,183,145,43,144,40,209,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
