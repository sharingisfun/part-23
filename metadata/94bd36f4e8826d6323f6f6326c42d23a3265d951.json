The patcher will not damage your computer, it will just hang.  Instead, you must drag and drop a file inside (Age of Empires III.app/Contents/MacOS/Age of Empires III) onto this patcher.  Instructions below.\n*THIS PATCH WILL ONLY WORK FOR v1.04.  Sorry for the all-caps, but some people on this site really need that kind of emphasis.\n\nHow to properly patch your game:\n1. Run the No CD program\n2. Go to Applications, find your AOE III program\n3. Right-click Age of Empires III, select 'Show Package Contents'\n4. In the pop-up window, open the 'Contents' folder\n5. Open the 'MacOS' folder\n6. Drag 'Age of Empires III' onto the patcher.\n7. Play the game\n\nAgain, this program will NOT patch your game unless it is for Mac, v1.04, and you follow these directions.  Confirmed working on an Intel MacBook running 10.5.6.\n\nI cannot take credit for this fine piece of work. Thanks to gUs for creating this patcher!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:94bd36f4e8826d6323f6f6326c42d23a3265d951","amp;dn":"Age_of_Empires_III_1.04_NoCd_Patch.zip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"94bd36f4e8826d6323f6f6326c42d23a3265d951","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,189,54,244,232,130,109,99,35,246,246,50,108,66,210,58,50,101,217,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
