This corresponding fixture last season saw Liverpool win 5-0 at White Hart Lane, a result which saw then-Spurs boss Andre Villas-Boas sacked. However, two of the Reds' five goals were scored by Luis Suarez, and this season they will have to cope without the Uruguayan live wire, who was allowed to join Barcelona. The day's second kick-off sees Leicester host Arsenal. The Foxes comfortably won last season's Championship, finishing nine points clear of their nearest rivals, but face a step up in class against the Gunners. Arsene Wenger's side ended their nine-year wait for silverware by winning the FA Cup last season, but the recruitment of former Barcelona forward Alexis Sanchez, who starred for Chile at the World Cup, has left Gunners fans dreaming of a first league title since 2004. Mark and guests also look back at the goals from Saturday's matches.\n\nThere's no MOTD next weekend due to international fixtures.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b7413c1cec8026235807b909be0c610bda11fa4b","amp;dn":"Match+of+the+Day+2+-+31st+August+2014+-+720p+X264+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b7413c1cec8026235807b909be0c610bda11fa4b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,65,60,28,236,128,38,35,88,7,185,9,190,12,97,11,218,17,250,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
