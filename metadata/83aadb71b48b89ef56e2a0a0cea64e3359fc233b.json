Beginning as early as 1939 when Germany first attacked Poland, Roosevelt skillfully navigated a host of challengesÃ¢â‚¬â€a reluctant population, an unprepared military, and disagreements within his cabinetÃ¢â‚¬â€to prepare the country for its inevitable confrontation with the Axis.\n\nIn No End Save Victory, esteemed historian David Kaiser draws on extensive archival research to reveal the careful preparations that enabled the United States to win World War II. Alarmed by Germany and JapanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s aggressive militarism, Roosevelt understood that the United States would almost certainly be drawn into the conflict raging in Europe and Asia. However, the American populace, still traumatized by memories of the First World War, was reluctant to intervene in European and Asian affairs. Even more serious was the deplorable state of the American military. In September of 1940, RooseveltÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s military advisors told him that the US would not have the arms, ammunition, or men necessary to undertake any major military operation overseasÃ¢â‚¬â€let alone win such a fightÃ¢â‚¬â€until April of 1942. Aided by his closest military and civilian collaborators, Roosevelt pushed a series of military expansions through Congress that nearly doubled the size of the US Navy and Army, and increased production of the arms, tanks, bombers, and warships that would allow America to prevail in the coming fight.\n\nHighlighting RooseveltÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s deft management of the strong personalities within his cabinet and his able navigation of the shifting tides of war, No End Save Victory is the definitive account of AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s preparations for and entry into World War II. As Kaiser shows, it was RooseveltÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s masterful leadership and prescience that prepared the reluctant nation to fightÃ¢â‚¬â€and gave it the tools to win.\n\n\n\n\nAbout Author :-\n\nDavid Kaiser has taught history at Harvard, Carnegie Mellon, the Naval War College, and Williams College. The author of seven books, including The Road to Dallas: The Assassination of John F. Kennedy, Kaiser lives in Watertown, Massachusetts.\n\n\n`~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`\n  SEED PLEASE , LET OTHERS GET IT TOO. \n `~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:83aadb71b48b89ef56e2a0a0cea64e3359fc233b","amp;dn":"No+End+Save+Victory+prabhu_","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"83aadb71b48b89ef56e2a0a0cea64e3359fc233b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,170,219,113,180,139,137,239,86,226,160,160,206,166,78,51,89,252,35,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
