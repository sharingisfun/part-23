Though his family members have resigned themselves to their downward spiral both socially and economically, the son of the household has not. He is ambitious to attain something and to strike out on his own. What happens instead is that he grows increasingly disillusioned about his life and his world.\n\nThrow Away Your Books is unquestionably a product of the late Sixties and early Seventies, when rebellion ruled the artistic roost and everything from ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œanti-theaterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œun-universitiesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ were in vogue. In the same way, Books is something like ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œanti-cinemaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½: itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s unburdened by anything like a linear plot or conventional storytelling, has no real beginning or end (or even a middle, really), and floats freely from one loony scene to the next. Despite all this, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not the unwatchable disaster it could very easily have been; itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s actually quite charming in its ragged insistence on being its own self.\n\nFile Name .........................................: Sho o suteyo machi e deyou .avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 2,026,768,384 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 2:17:30\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nFrame Size ......................................: 648x472 (AR: 1.373)\nFPS .................................................: 23.976\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 1732 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.236 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [B-VOP], [], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 224 kb/s [1 channel(s)] CBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0228853/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0228853/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAudio: Japanese\nSubtitles: English, Spanish and Portuguese (srt)\n\nMy rip of a DVD posted at asiandvdclub.org by ywngr\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ecc9b6bbb773db3f05217187279bba100fcc3042","amp;dn":"Throw+away+your+books%2C+Go+out+into+the+streets+%28Terayama%2C+1971%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ecc9b6bbb773db3f05217187279bba100fcc3042","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,201,182,187,183,115,219,63,5,33,113,135,39,155,186,16,15,204,48,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
