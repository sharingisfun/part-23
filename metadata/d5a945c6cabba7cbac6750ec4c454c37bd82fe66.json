BFG? Bellowing ferret-faced golfer? Backstabbing fairy godmother? Oh, oh ... Big Friendly Giant! This BFG doesn't seem all that F at first as he creeps down a London street, snatches little Sophie out of her bed, and bounds away with her to giant land. And he's not really all that B when compared with his evil, carnivorous brethren, who bully him for being such an oddball runt. After all, he eats only disgusting snozzcumbers, and while the other Gs are snacking on little boys and girls, he's blowing happy dreams in through their windows. What kind of way is that for a G to behave?\n\nThe BFG is one of Dahl's most lovable character creations. Whether galloping off with Sophie nestled into the soft skin of his ear to capture dreams as though they were exotic butterflies; speaking his delightful, jumbled, squib-fangled patois; or whizzpopping for the Queen, he leaves an indelible impression of bigheartedness. (Ages 9 to 12) --This text refers to the Hardcover edition.\nReview\n&quot;Roald Dahl and Quentin Blake are uncanny in their understanding of what children like to read and see. Sophie, an eight-year-old orphan, is kidnapped by the BFG (Big Friendly Giant) and taken to Giantland, where [her] alliance with the BFG and the queen of England results in the capture of the nine evil giants. Children will enjoy this book.&quot; --The New York Times Book Review\n--Review\n\n\nReading level: Ages 8 and up\nPaperback: 224 pages\nPublisher: Puffin Books (September 6, 2007)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0141322624\nISBN-13: 978-0141322629","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d5a945c6cabba7cbac6750ec4c454c37bd82fe66","amp;dn":"Big+Friendly+Giant+by+Roald+Dahl+%28Requested%29++%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d5a945c6cabba7cbac6750ec4c454c37bd82fe66","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,169,69,198,202,187,167,203,172,103,80,236,76,69,76,55,189,130,254,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
