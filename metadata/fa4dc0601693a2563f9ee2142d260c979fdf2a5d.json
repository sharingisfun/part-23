He was running a hamster colony at age eight and racing stick insects along his mother?s clothes line by the time he was nine. In his early teens, Nigel had graduated to larger creatures, keeping a caiman, magpie and boa constrictors in his parents? house. He even saved a freshwater eel from being jellied, housing it in the bathtub. When anyone needed a soak, the slippery creature was put in a bucket.\n\nFamily holidays in the Mediterranean became zoological expeditions, as young Nigel scampered over the countryside, pillowcase in hand, catching snakes and lizards for study and then release. Once his school studies were over, Nigel took a year-out travelling throughout America, where he met hellbenders and amphiumas in the wild (both are kinds of salamanders). Returning to the UK, he moved to Bristol to read Botany and Zoology at university. This would prove to be the ideal place for him, because firstly he could pursue his interest in the natural world at an academic level, and secondly, Bristol is the world capital of wildlife filmmaking.\n\nHe got his first job at the world-famous BBC Natural History Unit in Bristol, and stayed there for several years. It was there that he produced and directed episodes of major international projects such as The Life of Birds (with Sir David Attenborough), Realms of the Russian Bear, The Witness was a Fly and Magpie in the Dock. In 1998 he moved from the BBC to start work on an exciting new wildlife project for Granada Television; this time he would not only produce the films, but also be in front of the camera as a presenter.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       Human Senses - Vision &amp; Touch\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPart 3:\n\nVision\nWe only see what our brains want us to see. Nigel Marven sets out to discover why we are excellent at seeing some things, but sometimes miss what&amp;#039;s right in front of our eyes.\n\nChecking people out \nHumans&amp;#039; real speciality is checking each other out. We&amp;#039;re so good at it, we do it without even being aware of it. With the help of the latest eye-tracking technology and scientists from Sussex University, we show some unsuspecting volunteers what their eyes really get up to. We are also very skilled at gauging depth and distance. Nigel discovers how top baseball players manage to track a ball coming towards them at high speed. This skill is an extreme example of the basic hand/eye co-ordination that we all acquire as we grow up. \n\nLimited vision \nAlmost a third of our entire brain is devoted to vision, but there&amp;#039;s a limit to how much our eyes observe. In a simple experiment in a busy shopping centre, Nigel asks shoppers for directions and then switches places with someone else while the shopper is distracted. Most people failed to notice the switch and carried on giving directions. Dr Richard Wiseman of the University of Hertfordshire, explains that people&amp;#039;s brains weren&amp;#039;t paying attention to who was asking the questions because they were just concentrating on getting the directions right. So, ultimately, we only see what our brains want us to see.\n\nTouch\nHumans are very sensitive to touch, but different parts of our body have different sensitivities. Nigel demonstrates that when it comes to our sense of touch, humans are similar to elephants.\n \nTouch sensitivity \nWe have a few areas where we are extremely sensitive, just like the elephant&amp;#039;s trunk. The rest of our body is surprisingly insensitive, like the elephant&amp;#039;s thick hide. The different density of touch sensors in the skin in different parts of the body explains why some parts of the body seem to have a much lower pain threshold. A microscopic splinter in a finger can be extremely painful, while a cut on your leg may not hurt as much. Ultimately, pain involves much more than what&amp;#039;s happening with the touch sensors in the skin. It has a lot to do with what&amp;#039;s going on in the brain. At University College London, Professor Tony Dickenson has devised an experiment using mild electric shocks, which reveals how much more painful something will feel if you believe it is going to hurt ? and how painless it is, if you think you&amp;#039;ve taken a painkiller.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa4dc0601693a2563f9ee2142d260c979fdf2a5d","amp;dn":"BBC+Human+Senses+3+of+3+Nigel+Marven","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa4dc0601693a2563f9ee2142d260c979fdf2a5d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,77,192,96,22,147,162,86,63,158,226,20,45,38,12,151,159,223,42,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
