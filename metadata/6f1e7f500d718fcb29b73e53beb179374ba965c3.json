However, Chicago inventor and utilities magnate Samuel Insull, Chicago Tribune publisher Robert R. McCormick, and even Welles' own life were used in creating Kane.\n\nIn 1939, based partly on the strength of his imaginative and successful New York plays which were produced under the aegis of the Mercury Theater (such as an adaptation of William Shakespeare's Macbeth, which featured an all-black cast and was set in the jungle), and the infamy of his October 30, 1938 radio broadcast of H.G. Wells' The War of the Worlds which sent residents of Grover's Mill, New Jersey into a panic, Orson Welles was able to negotiate a virtually unheard-of two-picture deal with the relatively small RKO Pictures studio. The deal gave him near-total creative control and, arguably, overshadowed the production of films also considered classics: Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's Gone With the Wind and The Wizard of Oz and RKO's own Gunga Din.\n\nThe Battle Over Citizen Kane also details the lives of Orson Welles and William Randolph Hearst before Citizen Kane, Hearst's manipulation of the heads of the four largest Hollywood studios: Columbia Pictures, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Paramount Pictures, and Warner Bros. to combine their efforts and financial strength to buy the film from RKO with the express purpose of destroying it, and how the film affected their lives after the release of the film.\n\nDuring this period, however, William Randolph Hearst was actually millions of dollars in debt due largely to excessive spending, particularly on his continuing construction of his already sprawling mansion near San Simeon, California which was located on a property approximately half the size of the state of Rhode Island. While married to Millicent Hearst, he kept a mistress over twenty years his junior, the actress Marion Davies. Davies had been a silent film-era star who worked on a number of &quot;talkies&quot;, but with lesser success.\n\nAfter the release of Citizen Kane to relatively positive critical reviews and largely indifferent popular response, Orson Welles moved on to his second project, The Magnificent Ambersons. However, after Citizen Kane did not become a money-maker, The Magnificent Ambersons was wrested from his control. RKO re-edited the film itself and released it.\n\nWilliam Randolph Hearst died in 1951; Orson Welles died in 1985.\n\nThe events chronicled in The Battle Over Citizen Kane were dramatized in the 1999 HBO film, RKO 281. &quot;281&quot; was the internal production name of Citizen Kane.\n\nThe Battle Over Citizen Kane was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature, but lost to Anne Frank Remembered.\n\nHowever the documentary has come under serious criticism by several Welles scholars and critics. Jonathan Rosenbaum writes that, &quot;Perhaps the cardinal failing of The Battle Over ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCitizen KaneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, a 1996 Oscar-nominated documentary, is its nearly groundless argument that Hearst and Welles had a lot of things in common.&quot;.\n\nDavid Walsh writes that, &quot;This sort of superficial comparisonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½a cat has a head, a dog has a head, therefore a cat equals a dogÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½conceals far more than it reveals.&quot; He adds that, &quot;The documentary filmmakers fail to make any reference to this social and political context. Furthermore, because they identify success with a stable career and a steady income, they think Welles's subsequent work hardly worth considering.&quot;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f1e7f500d718fcb29b73e53beb179374ba965c3","amp;dn":"The+Battle+Over+Citizen+Kane+%28multi+subs%29+%28TV%29+%5B1996%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f1e7f500d718fcb29b73e53beb179374ba965c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,30,127,80,13,113,143,203,41,183,62,83,190,177,121,55,75,169,101,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
