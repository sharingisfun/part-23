Have you?\n\nIn the technological arena, three years is a lifetime. Since the first edition of this book was published in 2004, built-in security measures on compilers and operating systems have become commonplace, but are still far from perfect. Arbitrary-code execution vulnerabilities still allow attackers to run code of their choice on your systemÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½with disastrous results.\n\nIn a nutshell, this book is about code and data and what happens when the two become confused. YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll work with the basic building blocks of security bugsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½assembler, source code, the stack, the heap, and so on. YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll experiment, explore, and understand the systems youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re runningÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and how to better protect them.\n\nBecome familiar with security holes in Windows, Linux, Solaris, Mac OS X, and CiscoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s IOS\nLearn how to write customized tools to protect your systems, not just how to use ready-made ones\nUse a working exploit to verify your assessment when auditing a network\nUse proof-of-concept exploits to rate the significance of bugs in software youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re developing\nAssess the quality of purchased security products by performing penetration tests based on the information in this book\nUnderstand how bugs are found and how exploits work at the lowest level\nBook Details\nPaperback: 744 pages\nPublisher: Wiley; 2nd Edition (August 2007)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 9780470080238\nISBN-13: 978-0470080238","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e7d566bd68891b3dff9f63d80c360eeb5a928c6","amp;dn":"Wiley.The.Shellcoders.Handbook.2nd.Edition.Aug.2007","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e7d566bd68891b3dff9f63d80c360eeb5a928c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,125,86,107,214,136,145,179,223,249,246,61,128,195,96,238,181,169,40,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
