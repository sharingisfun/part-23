With their mixture of melodic metal and elements of classical music influenced by the cinema soundtracks, the Italians created a complete new genre: The Symphonic Metal.\n\nGuitarist Luca Turilli and keyboarder Alex Staropoli started in 1993 under the name of Thundercross, influenced by acts like Helloween, Blind Guardian, Cacophony, Yngwie Malmsteen and Crinsom Glory. With their first demo ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLand Of ImmortalsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ the young guys from Trieste were signed by the new label LMP Records, which was founded by the former Helloween manager Limb Schnoor who effectively established the band. The new singer Fabio Lione completed the band and just before the production of the debut they renamed the group in Rhapsody. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLegendary TalesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ with its pompous choirs and an orchestra was released in 1997. The lyrical content was based on the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œEmerald Sword SagaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, an epic fantasy tale written by Luca Turilli.\n\nIn 2006 Rhapsody was forced to rename into Rhapsody of Fire because of a copyright complaint of a same-titled US band. The following extensive world tour was a great success and the DVD ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œVisions From The Enchanted LandsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, released in 2007, provides into it.\n\n\nCurrent Members:\n\nFabio Lione - Vocals\nLuca Turilli - Guitar\nAlex Staropoli - Keyboards\nPatrice Guers - Bass\nAlex Holzwarth - Drums\n\nVisions From the Enchanted Lands:\n\nFollowing on from their debut album Legendary Tales, this concert footage taken from their 2005 tour of Canada finds Rhapsody Of fire performing many of their best-known material, behind the scenes footage, interviews and videos.
