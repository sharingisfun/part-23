Following sudden open-heart surgery, Case walked out of the hospital with two things: a renewed vigor for life and music, and a six-figure medical bill he couldn't pay. Case's fans and peers like T-Bone Burnett, Richard Thompson, Joe Henry and Loudon Wainwright III immediately rallied to organize a benefit concert to help with his obligations. Recovered physically and emboldened by the generosity of his fans and friends, Peter recorded the raucous and dirty electric blues rock of Wig! in only three days. ''It felt really good to rock again,'' says Case. The album features X drummer DJ Bonebrake and Ron Franklin (Gasoline Silver). With heart pumping and blood flowing, Wig! sees Case reinvigorate the rock n' roll roots he laid down in his seminal bands The Nerves and The Plimsouls.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8969e68a2c01324511ed83227b5116671432bb78","amp;dn":"Peter+Case+-+Wig%21+%5B2010%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8969e68a2c01324511ed83227b5116671432bb78","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,105,230,138,44,1,50,69,17,237,131,34,123,81,22,103,20,50,187,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
