They never finished it. Most of the sessions came out on the Nightcap compilation in 1993. A few more appeared on the bootleg Minstrels in the Red House. For this reconstruction, we\\'ve brought in tracks from all the best sources: besides Nightcap and Minstrels, we\\'ve used the MFSL CDs of A Passion Play and War Child and the DCC CD of Original Masters. A few tracks are only speculative additions that may never have been intended for the record but help flesh out the first LP (those who prefer the certainties may choose to remove these from the program.) The bootleg material went through a careful restoration procedure to remove a good share of the noise and fix the EQ while preserving the character of the underlying music as carefully as possible. The material from Nightcap, which was heavily smiley-face EQed on the official CD, has been carefully re-adjusted to make things sound the way they should.\n\nThere is no artwork, mostly because Tull\\'s stay at the ChÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢teau is not well-represented with photographs. (I welcome anyone who wishes to create some album art for this.) Instead, we have a five-page PDF with notes on the album, including its history and how this reconstruction came together. Also included are the raw materials that went into reconstructing Side 4 of the album, including the bootleg-only version of Side 4 with and without noise reduction and EQ. We like to put together a comprehensive package (partly so anyone who feels they could remaster the album better has the raw materials to work with.)\n\nIan Anderson has stated that engineer Steven Wilson, the man behind the remixes of Aqualung and Thick as a Brick, is keen to put out an official release of the complete ChÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢teau sessions. We hope that he does. In the meantime, this reconstruction is the one to have.\n\n~ Captain S","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:13315756789d5030946a0dfc4898902b211f0808","amp;dn":"Jethro+Tull+-+The+Lost+Chateau+Album+%28A+Partial+Reconstruction%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"13315756789d5030946a0dfc4898902b211f0808","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,49,87,86,120,157,80,48,148,106,13,252,72,152,144,43,33,31,8,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
