Here is what said website has to say about this work...\n\n\n&quot;Alan MooreÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s work from Sounds is his largest body of work that remains uncollected or reprinted at this point. From March 31st 1979 to March 19th 1983 Alan Moore (as Curt Vile) penciled and wrote/co-wrote with Steve Moore (as Pedro Henry) a 1 page strip for the UK music paper Sounds. The chances of this ever being collected are slim to none (but with anything Moore thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s always a slight hope), but until then the internet is the only way itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s going to happen.&quot;\n\n\nWell, no, because in 2009 I went through the website, downloaded and sequenced every image, added an introduction/title/table of contents page and turned it all into to a cbr file (I was going though a SERIOUS Alan Moore phase).\n\n\nSo here you have Alan and Steve Moore's complete 'Sounds' collection, 1979-1983, 189 pages.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:14cd82d8a0da2e899d14fecdd6e9cec904a41d1d","amp;dn":"The+Complete+Alan+Moore+Sounds+Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"14cd82d8a0da2e899d14fecdd6e9cec904a41d1d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,205,130,216,160,218,46,137,157,20,254,205,214,233,206,201,4,164,29,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
