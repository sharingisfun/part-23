The album was recorded in four days at the Kol HaCampus studios, straight to tape, using vintage and analogue equipment from the '60s and the '70s. The anticipation around this debut has garnered interest and invitations from clubs and records labels around the globe.\n\nConcept &amp; Executive Production: Kol Hacampus\nThe school of media studies, The College of Management Academic Studies","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:425a1f113aad5c4dfee8a5bfdc2c90c2af75d53a","amp;dn":"Electric+Zoo+-+%282013%29+Diamonds+in+the+Sand+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"425a1f113aad5c4dfee8a5bfdc2c90c2af75d53a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,90,31,17,58,173,92,77,254,232,165,191,220,44,144,194,175,117,213,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
