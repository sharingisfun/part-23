The 1990 mastering is solid with good bass and no loudness wars.\n\n- Big Papi\n\n[quote]By The Groove\n\nAfter the straight-shooting classic that was &quot;Back in Black,&quot; AC/DC had a bumpy ride for much of the 1980s. They continued to release solid albums, but their sales began to dip after 1981's &quot;For Those About to Rock We Salute You.&quot; But 1990 was the year the Australian boys reclaimed the hard rock throne with their tough album &quot;The Razors Edge&quot; (hold the apostrophe). That record blasted to Number Two and went multiplatinum in a year when folks like MC Hammer dominated the charts. Produced by the late Bruce Fairbairn (who also worked with Bon Jovi, Poison, and Aerosmith), &quot;The Razors Edge&quot; may not be a classic, but it roars with energy and spunk. Like any AC/DC record, this CD revolves around three themes: sex, drugs (with booze), and rock and roll. The hits on this CD are the rousing &quot;Thunderstruck&quot; and the top 40 hit &quot;Moneytalks,&quot; but other killer cuts are the funny &quot;Got You By the Balls,&quot; &quot;Are You Ready,&quot; the ever-festive &quot;Mistress for Christmas,&quot; and &quot;Fire Your Guns.&quot; Like Robert John &quot;Mutt&quot; Lange, Fairbairn's production is a bit on the polished side, but it doesn't compromise AC/DC's sound. Angus Young's guitar still rocks, and Brian Johnson's bark continues to roar in all its shrill glory. I'm not a metalhead by any means, but I know a good album when I hear one. &quot;The Razors Edge&quot; is just that.[/quote]\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n AC/DC - The Razors Edge (ATCO A2 91413)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: AC/DC\nAlbum................: The Razors Edge (ATCO A2 91413)\nGenre................: Rock\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1990 09\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.3.0 20130526\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: 100 %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n Tracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n 1.
