He is the author of numerous books on crossing cultures.  An essayist for Time since 1986, he also publishes regularly in Harper's, The New York Review of Books, The New York Times, and many other publications.\n\nHaving grown up a part of -- and apart from -- English, American and Indian cultures, Iyer was one of the first writers to take the international airport itself as his subject, along with the associated jet lag, displacement and cultural minglings.  He writes often of his delight in living between the cracks and outside fixed categories.  The Utne Reader named him in 1995 as one of 100 Visionaries worldwide who could change your life, while the New Yorker observed that &quot;as a guide to far-flung places, Pico Iyer can hardly be surpassed.&quot;\n\n\nThe following books are in ePUB format:\n\n* ABANDON: A Romance (Vintage, 2004)\n\n* FALLING OFF THE MAP: Some Lonely Places of the World (Vintage, 1994)\n\n* THE GLOBAL SOUL: Jet Lag, Shopping Malls, and the Search for Home (Vintage, 2001)\n\n* THE LADY AND THE MONK: Four Seasons in Kyoto (Vintage, 1992)\n\n* THE MAN WITHIN MY HEAD (Knopf, 2012)\n\n* THE OPEN ROAD: The Global Journey of the Fourteenth Dalai Lama (Knopf, 2008)\n\n* SUN AFTER DARK: Flights into the Foreign (Vintage, 2005)\n\n* VIDEO NIGHT IN KATHMANDU &amp; Other Reports from the Not-So-Far-East (Vintage, 1989)\n\n________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nNOTE: I can be contacted via the SuprBay forum with comments, suggestions, requests, error reports, etc.:\n                            &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/User-workerbee&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/User-workerbee&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIf you like these books and want others to have access to them, please consider seeding for as long as you can.
