Wrong race. Wrong gender. Wrong class. Wrong side of the tracks. Wrong attitude. America in the near future is a cold, cruel place, especially in the hardscrabble rural Pacific Northwest. There's war in the Middle East, a revived draft, mass unemployment, an economy permanently on the skids, greed and corruption, incompetence and stupidity at the top. Poor blue-collar kids from the trailer park are last in line for everything. America has screwed Shane Ryan, and he returns the favor. He joins the Northwest Volunteer Army, a terrorist organization dedicated to overthrowing the United States government and establishing an independent nation. America is about to learn the hard way that what goes around, comes around. \n\n\n\n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:49d5517243de4d651577da0c566c8822a630ea7c","amp;dn":"A+Distant+Thunder","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"49d5517243de4d651577da0c566c8822a630ea7c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,213,81,114,67,222,77,101,21,119,218,12,86,108,136,34,166,48,234,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
