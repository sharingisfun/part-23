It was produced by Desmond Child.\n\nIt features the song &quot;Hide Your Heart&quot; written by Paul Stanley, Desmond Child and Holly Knight. This song was later covered four times in 1989 on Kiss' Hot in the Shade, Ace Frehley's Trouble Walkin', Robin Beck's Trouble Or Nothin', and Molly Hatchet's Lightning Strikes Twice. It also features the original version of the track &quot;Save Up All Your Tears&quot;, which would be covered, with a faster arrangement, by Cher on her 1991 album Love Hurts.\n\nAnother album track is &quot;The Best&quot;, later covered by Tina Turner. Also included is Bonnie Tyler's remake of Turner's 1986 &quot;Don't Turn Around&quot; (which was also a #1 UK hit for Aswad in 1988 and an international hit by Ace of Base in 1994).\n\n\nTrack listing\n\nNotes From America&quot; (Desmond Child/Robbie Seidman)\nHide Your Heart&quot; (Paul Stanley/Child/Holly Knight)\nDon't Turn Around&quot; (Diane Warren/Albert Hammond)\nSave Up All Your Tears&quot; (Child/Warren)\nTo Love Somebody&quot; (Barry Gibb/Robin Gibb/Maurice Gibb)\nTake Another Look At Your Heart&quot; (Michael Bolton/Child)\nThe Best&quot; (Mike Chapman/Knight)\nShy With You&quot; (Seidman)\nStreets Of Little Italy&quot; (Seidman)\nTurtle Blues&quot; (Janis Joplin) ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0dad136c1028e1e5cd67fdbd55fe0e44d27ccf12","amp;dn":"Hide+Your+Heart+by+Bonnie+Tyler+%28Audio+CD-+1988%29-Flac+by+Winker%40","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0dad136c1028e1e5cd67fdbd55fe0e44d27ccf12","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,173,19,108,16,40,225,229,205,103,253,189,85,254,14,68,210,124,207,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
