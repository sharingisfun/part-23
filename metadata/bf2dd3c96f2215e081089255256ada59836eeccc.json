His greatest achievement is Dolby Pro Logic II, which took him years to refine and was released to market in 2000, eventually winning him a special Emmy award in 2003.  The documentary provides an overview of his life by direct interviews with him, his family, close friends and archive video/pictures.\n\nThis is a direct rip of the DVD as sent to me by Jim Fosgate.  I don't think it had an official release so I thought it might interest those who want to know more about pioneers of technology like him.\n\nEncoded with Handbrake (High Profile @ 1500kb/s), with MKV Merge to remux.\n\nOriginal NTSC DVD 720x480 resolution kept, original AC3 stereo audio.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf2dd3c96f2215e081089255256ada59836eeccc","amp;dn":"Jim.Fosgate.The.Wizard.of.Fos.DVDRip.480p.x264-ZeKe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf2dd3c96f2215e081089255256ada59836eeccc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,45,211,201,111,34,21,224,129,8,146,85,37,106,218,89,131,110,236,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
