They're mainly just him talking about random stuff.\n\nAll of the videos are in .flv format, in the highest quality possible, and not watermarked. The file names include 1) the order that the videos where recorded in, 2) the names that Randy gave each of the videos, and 3) the date that the videos were recorded.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nSincerely,\nThe PioneersProductions Archivist\n - imatu - ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c635ad41b0f6be80d60dcbb70f612ecd6d4c5c8","amp;dn":"PioneersProductions+BlogTV+Recordings","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c635ad41b0f6be80d60dcbb70f612ecd6d4c5c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,99,90,212,27,15,107,232,13,96,220,187,112,246,18,236,214,212,197,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
