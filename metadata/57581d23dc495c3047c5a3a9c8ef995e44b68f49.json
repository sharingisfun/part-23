ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s uncommonly (but not offensively) close on Belle BrigadeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s debut, a collection of sunny pop songs that take their cues from the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCalifornia soundÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ of yesteryear. Fronted by the brother/sister combo Ethan and Barbara Gruska, the group blows through 11 tunes in an economical 39 minutes, evoking everyone from CSNY to Linda Ronstadt along the way. The siblings harmonize the way family members often do, flanking each otherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s melodies during the verses and double-tracking their voices into thick chords during the choruses. With help from a rotating roster of backup musicians -- mostly BarbaraÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s cohorts from her days as a touring drummer for Inara George and Jenny Lewis -- the siblings cast a wide net, riding a country-rock groove on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMy GoodnessÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and resurrecting the breezy charm of Rumours-era Lindsey Buckingham on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWhere Not to Look for FreedomÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ before drifting into the Los Angeles smog with the albumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s hazy closer, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFasten You to Me.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Like Jenny and Johnny, another SoCal harmony duo, they rarely sing without the other personÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s help, and this pastoral pop record sparkles whenever the two lock together in close harmony.\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\n[img]http://www.hotimg.com/direct/CAWuxEb.gif[/img]\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/about/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:57581d23dc495c3047c5a3a9c8ef995e44b68f49","amp;dn":"The+Belle+Brigade...The+Belle+Brigade%282011%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"57581d23dc495c3047c5a3a9c8ef995e44b68f49","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,88,29,35,220,73,92,48,71,197,163,169,200,239,153,94,68,182,143,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
