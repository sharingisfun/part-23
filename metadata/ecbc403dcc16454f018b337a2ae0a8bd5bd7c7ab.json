He\nshould know how to make a good campfire, what types of wood give fast heat for boiling tea, and what\ntypes provide hot flames for broiling steaks. He should know how to paddle a canoe, how to forecast\nweather, how to use a compass, what the sudden cry of a bluejay means, and what a bear is up to when\nhe stands on his hind legs. The average outdoorsman does not have to be a wilderness survival expert,\nbut he should know the basics.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ecbc403dcc16454f018b337a2ae0a8bd5bd7c7ab","amp;dn":"THE+COMPLETE+OUTDOORSMANS+HANDBOOK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ecbc403dcc16454f018b337a2ae0a8bd5bd7c7ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,188,64,61,204,22,69,79,1,139,51,122,42,224,168,189,91,215,199,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
