Most other possibilities are blocked (makes you think, especially when you are the president). I have a plan that only has a chance when asked for by the right people (Sometimes it is like that, Obama will understand).\n\nThere is only one reason this unlikely event (idealistic ideaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s have become a necessity) might happen and that is when we recognize a chance. No matter how small. So please seed.\n\nMusic is a way to communicate and sometimes it can even be a bridge.\n\nEnjoy\n\n\nDutch Treat - Sweetlist C009 Dear Mr. President (Jazzy Pop)\n\n01 - The Air That I Breathe (Alexis Jordan)\n02 - The Last Chance Texaco (Rickie Lee Jones)\n03 - There Is Still Hope (Everette Harp)\n04 - So What!
