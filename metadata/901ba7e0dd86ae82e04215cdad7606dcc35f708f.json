The record includes original works by Hubbard and Shaw as well as covers by Lee Morgan, Clifford Brown and others. Double Take has appearances by musicians: Cecil McBee, Carl Allen, Mulgrew Miller and Kenny Garrett.\n\n\n Other than their joint appearance as sidemen on Benny Golson's Time Speaks in 1983, Freddie Hubbard and Woody Shaw had never recorded together before Double Take. At this point in their evolution, Hubbard still gets the edge (his range is wider and he cannot be surpassed technically). Although Shaw tended to play more harmonically sophisticated lines and is remarkably inventive, they are both trumpet masters. Their meeting on Double Take was more of a collaboration than a trumpet battle; in fact, the brass giants only trade off briefly on &quot;Lotus Blossom&quot;.  \n\n\nTracklist:\n\n 01 - Sandu\n 02 - Boperation\n 03 - Lament For Booker\n 04 - Hub-Tones\n 05 - Desert Moonlight\n 06 - Just A Ballad For Woody\n 07 - Lotus Blossom\n\n Produced by Michael Cuscuna.\n\nMusicians:\n Freddie Hubbard - trumpet, flugelhorn\n Woody Shaw - trumpet\n Kenny Garrett - alto saxophone, flute\n Mulgrew Miller - piano\n Cecil McBee - bass\n Carl Allen - drums","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:901ba7e0dd86ae82e04215cdad7606dcc35f708f","amp;dn":"Freddie+Hubbard+%26amp%3B+Woody+Shaw+-+Double+Take+%281985%29+24-192","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"901ba7e0dd86ae82e04215cdad7606dcc35f708f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,27,167,224,221,134,174,130,224,66,21,205,173,118,6,220,195,95,112,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
