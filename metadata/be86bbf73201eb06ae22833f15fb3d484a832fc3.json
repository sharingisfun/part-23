Country music became a true hotbed of activity as the '40s ended, with labels both major and independent recording and manufacturing titles in record numbers. The music on this 28-track set offers a small example of the wealth that was flooding jukeboxes, small independent radio stations, and even ending up in record shops across the nation. Some of the selections here, such as Ghost Riders in the Sky by Vaughn Monroe, and Hank Williams' Lovesick Blues are equaled by those of Leon McAuliffe's Panhandle Rag, Bill Nettles' Hadacol Boogie, and Johnnie &amp; Jack's What About You. Leon Payne's brilliant,. I Love You Because, and Tennessee Ernie Ford's Mule Train are here as well. None of these cuts are necessarily rare, but placed in sequence like this makes for an amazing mix reproduced in almost uniformly excellent sound quality. Highly recommended. \n(Thom Jurek)\n\n- - -\n\nVA - Dim Lights, Thick Smoke And Hillbilly Music 1949\n(Bear Family Records 2008)\n\n\n     1.
