Well, it&amp;#039;s hard to deny that Avenue Q&amp;#039;s main frame of reference is Sesame Street and that its humor can be very broad--yes, there&amp;#039;s profanity and puppet sex. But the show also displays heart (&quot;The More You Ruv Someone&quot; typically begins with &quot;Why can&amp;#039;t people get along?&quot;) and a pretty satisfying zany streak. Musically, the score is rooted in 1970s pop, with nods to the aforementioned Sesame Street. The excellent cast, dominated by John Tartaglia and Stephanie D&amp;#039;Abruzzo, does it justice, milking the humorous numbers for all they&amp;#039;re worth and finding pathos in the more straightforward ones. Not bad for a childish show. --Elisabeth Vincentelli\n\nThe CD was ripped using EAC to WAV then encoded in FLAC for maximum quality retention.\n\nFLAC stands for Free Lossless Audio Codec.
