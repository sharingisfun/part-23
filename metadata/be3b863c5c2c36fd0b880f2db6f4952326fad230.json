'Symptoms Of A Stranger' is set to fill your mind with\nprogressive rapture, guided by the voice of UK's vocalist Cathy Burton.\nFondling trance and progressive, 'Symptoms Of A Stranger' resounds\nsomewhere between the mesmerizing stars and the deep, dark ground \ntrembling on its beat.\n\nSpanish producer Henry Saiz, re-worker of tracks by Way Out West, John \nDigweed and TiÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â«sto, added a unique touch of warmth to 'Symptoms Of A \nStranger' on his Space Oddity remix, that doesn't let itself be captured \ninto the 'prog-house' genre only.\n\nThe cherry on top of all this, is 'Triangle &amp; Strings'. An outstanding \npiece of music that takes you in at an instant, riding on a deep \nprogressive-trance sound of strings, synths and tantalizing beats.\n\n\n************************************************************************\n\nTracklist\n\n************************************************************************\n\n01.
