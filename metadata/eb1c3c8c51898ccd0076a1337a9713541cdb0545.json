The 2nd show fragment is in one piece.\n\nIts a good show with not enough electricity in the building to power those amps properly, but the JHE make the best of it. \n\nA lot more could be said about this tape, but i'm not going to. \n\nThanks to Morelmusic, Relliott, voodoo_child58. \n\nEnjoy!\n\n\n\n1968-05-25 Rome, Teatro Brancaccio \n\n1st show\n\n1 intro, I Dont Live Today\n2 I Dont Live Today (part 2)\n3 Hey Joe\n4 Stone Free\n5 Manic Depression\n6 Foxy Lady\n7 Red House\n8 Wild Thing\n9 Wild Thing (part 2)\n\n2nd show\n\n10 Intro &gt; Fire &gt; Stone Free\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb1c3c8c51898ccd0076a1337a9713541cdb0545","amp;dn":"Jimi+Hendrix+1968.05.25+Rome+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb1c3c8c51898ccd0076a1337a9713541cdb0545","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,28,60,140,81,137,140,205,0,118,161,51,122,151,19,84,28,219,5,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
