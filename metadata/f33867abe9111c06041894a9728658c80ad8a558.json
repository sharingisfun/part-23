It satirizes conservative personality-driven political pundit programs, particularly Fox News's The O'Reilly Factor. The show focuses on a fictional anchorman character named Stephen Colbert, played by his real-life namesake. The character, described by Colbert as a &quot;well-intentioned, poorly informed, high-status idiot&quot;, is a caricature of televised political pundits.\n\nThe Colbert Report has been nominated for four Emmys each in 2006, 2007 and 2008, two Television Critics Association Awards, and two Satellite Awards. It has been presented as non-satirical journalism in several instances, by the Tom DeLay Legal Defense Trust, and following Robert Wexler's interview on the program. The Report received considerable media coverage following its debut on October 17, 2005, for Colbert's coining of the term &quot;truthiness&quot;, which dictionary publisher Merriam-Webster named its 2006 Word of the Year.\n\n======================================================\nGeneral Information\n======================================================\n\nStatus: Airing 2013\nPremiere: October 17, 2005\nClassification: Talk Shows\nGenre: Comedy | News | Talk-Show\nNetwork: Comedy Central (USA)\nAirs: Monday through Thursdays at 11:30 pm\nRuntime: 30 Minutes\n\nMonday thru Thursday - All Year - With Seasonal &amp; Occasional Breaks\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f33867abe9111c06041894a9728658c80ad8a558","amp;dn":"The.Colbert.Report.2013.06.10.Dan.Savage.HDTV.x264-2HD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f33867abe9111c06041894a9728658c80ad8a558","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,56,103,171,233,17,28,6,4,24,148,169,114,134,88,200,10,216,165,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
