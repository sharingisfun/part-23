The original site for\nthese pdf&amp;#039;s is http://www.librum.us/ .  It seems that the original site\nisn&amp;#039;t using the pdf format anymore, instead trying to use restrictive\nwindows applications to contain the books.\n\nMany of these books are old cook books, and old gardening books\nand it may be pleasant to read these from time to time.  I will try to\nmaintain the seed as long as I possibly can, but I can&amp;#039;t make any\nguarantees that the seed will be anywhere close to permanent.  If\nthe site, http://www.nwosurvival.com/ , is still up and running, you\nmay want to get the pdf&amp;#039;s from there, and help seed this torrent.\nThe bandwidth at that site is much larger than mine.  I&amp;#039;m posting\nthese here, since that site may disappear in the near future.\n\nThanks :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f3e1592eb9b694b4f4a59950980613589f30228","amp;dn":"www.nwosurvival.com","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f3e1592eb9b694b4f4a59950980613589f30228","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,62,21,146,235,155,105,75,79,74,89,149,9,128,97,53,137,243,2,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
