Everything has been placed in correct reading order including the two annuals that took place during the Last Son arc. Due to the nature of his run and a brief hiatus during Last Son, I will be compiling a torrent that covers the entire Chris Kent Saga, as to better understand the complete story line that was undertaken by other writers as well. \n\n-Secret Origin \n-Up, Up and Away\n-Last Son\n-Escape from Bizarro World\n-Superman and the Legion of Super-Heroes\n-Brainiac\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cad179f777dd5fecee6b8e4e1180fe39e748e49d","amp;dn":"Superman+-+The+Complete+Geoff+Johns+Era","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cad179f777dd5fecee6b8e4e1180fe39e748e49d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,209,121,247,119,221,95,236,238,107,142,78,17,128,254,57,231,72,228,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
