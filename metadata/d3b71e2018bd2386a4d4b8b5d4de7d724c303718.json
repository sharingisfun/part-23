What is Snakefarm? Acid-blues? Folk-funk? Troubadour Trip-hop? None - or all - of the above?\n\n&quot;I've been trying to figure out what exactly Snakefarm is since I first came up the idea,&quot; confesses chief instigator Anna Domino. Mating entrancing, minimalist grooves and Domino's cool vocal delivery with classic tales of tragedy, trains and this country's vast size and violent history. Snakefarm's debut &quot;Songs From My Funeral,&quot; provides a refreshing perspective on the timeless nature of traditional American folksongs. The title may ring familiar - &quot;Tom Dooley,&quot; &quot;Frankie and Johnny,&quot; &quot;St. James Infirmary&quot; - but you've never heard them interpreted like this before.\n\nSnakefarm was officially hatched at the intersection of New York City's Houston and Crosby Streets in the summer of 1995, but assorted essential seeds for the project were sown years earlier. Domino hooked up with Snakefarm co-conspirator Michel Delory, a Belgian guitarist and arranger who designed on as a member of her band (and eventually became her husband) nine years before. \n\nTrack listing:\n\n1.
