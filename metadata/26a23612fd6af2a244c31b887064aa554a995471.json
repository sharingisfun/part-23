This abundant dietary antioxidant constitutes a bioactive ingredient of many foods that may offer beneficial effects against cancer, diabetes and neurodegenerative diseases, among others. This book discusses the antioxidant properties of FA and aims to cover the main aspects related to its use in the food, health and cosmetics industries, as well as to present important advances in its bioconversion into commercially valuable molecules","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:26a23612fd6af2a244c31b887064aa554a995471","amp;dn":"Ferulic+Acid+-+Antioxidant+Properties%2C+Uses+and+Potential+Health","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"26a23612fd6af2a244c31b887064aa554a995471","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,162,54,18,253,106,242,162,68,195,27,136,112,100,170,85,74,153,84,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
