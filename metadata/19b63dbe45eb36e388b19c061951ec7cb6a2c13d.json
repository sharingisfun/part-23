The book presents international views on teachers' learning from their practice; the chapters are written by mathematicians or mathematics educators from Brazil, Canada, Israel, Mexico, UK, and USA. They address diverse content ??ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ numerical literacy, geometry, algebra, and real analysis ??ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ and a variety of levels ??ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ elementary school, secondary school, undergraduate mathematics, and teacher education courses. The authors employ different methodological tools and different theoretical perspectives as they consider teaching in different learning environments: lecturing, small group work on problems and tasks, mathematical explorations with the support of technological software, or e-learning. Despite these differences, the authors exemplify and analyze teachers' learning that occurred and address the question: &quot;What kinds of knowledge are developed as a result of teaching mathematics and what are the factors that support or impede such development?&quot;......................\n\n\n\n[/color][/code][/b]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:19b63dbe45eb36e388b19c061951ec7cb6a2c13d","amp;dn":"Learning+Through+Teaching+Mathematics-Mantesh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"19b63dbe45eb36e388b19c061951ec7cb6a2c13d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,182,61,190,69,235,54,227,136,177,156,6,25,81,236,124,182,162,193,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
