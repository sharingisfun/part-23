However, what if the aliens weren&amp;#039;t really dead? In &quot;War of the Worlds&quot; the aliens from the 1953 invasion are brought out of suspended animation when radiation kills the infecting bacteria. Now the aliens launch a genocidal war against an unsuspecting Earth, using their ability to take over human bodies to allow them to move freely. Dr. Harrison Blackwood teams up with microbiologist Suzanne McCullough, computer programmer Norton Drake, and army Lt. Colonel Paul Ironhorse to save the world from this alien menace.\n\n\nUser Comments:\nBefore the X-Files, before Millenium, Space Above and Beyond, before Nowhere Man and all of the other strange and paranoid filled shows on television, there was War of the Worlds. Set in modern times, this series employed so many disturbing images and stories, it genuinely gave me creeps at night. While the show bombed on many levels with viewers, I only remember it for being something different, out of the ordinary. While young kids were watching cartoons, I tried watching this show as often as possible, considering my parents cared little for it. Then, when it went into syndication, I watched it as often as I could. If you could ever find tapes for this series, and you like odd and unusual programming, then you will like this series.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094578/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094578/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/War-Worlds-Complete-First-Season/dp/B000AOEMX2/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/War-Worlds-Complete-First-Season/dp/B000AOEMX2/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:37b66b0485ab7e51f53f8be7204e67f966a91723","amp;dn":"War.of.the.Worlds.Thplete.First.Season","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"37b66b0485ab7e51f53f8be7204e67f966a91723","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,182,107,4,133,171,126,81,245,63,139,231,32,78,103,249,102,169,23,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
