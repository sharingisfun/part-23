Here&amp;#039;s what we put on this one:\n\n\n\nVideo 1-2: Yoga Zone: Stretching for Flexibility &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Yoga-Zone-Stretching-Flexibility/dp/B00005RIXI/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/002-7454396-2428833?ie=UTF8&amp;s=dvd&amp;qid=1183556921&amp;sr=1-1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Yoga-Zone-Stretching-Flexibility/dp/B00005RIXI/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/002-7454396-2428833?ie=UTF8&amp;s=dvd&amp;qid=1183556921&amp;sr=1-1&lt;/a&gt;\n\nVideo 3:Ana Caban Pilates Abs &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.gaiam.com/retail/product/90-0097&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.gaiam.com/retail/product/90-0097&lt;/a&gt;\n\nVideo 4-6: Power Yoga Strength Flexibility &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://rodneyyeeyogastore.com/120-1314.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://rodneyyeeyogastore.com/120-1314.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nEDITORIAL:\nThe intro menu has an 8-minute long relaxation audio track for your cool down, plus lots of gratuitous animation (We won&amp;#039;t make that mistake again- it adds too much to the overall size).\n\nThe Pilates video- Okay, not Yoga but the woman in green is buff and it&amp;#039;s a damn good workout.  Ad hand weights or a medicine ball when it gets easy.\n\nThe Rodney Yee strength video gets into some of those funky cool positions the beginner DVDs never touch.  That said, it very Vinyasa-based so get prepared for forward bend/plank/downdog combo ad-nauseum.\n\nThe Yoga Zones are okay.  Nice when you need a decent 20-minute session, but you won&amp;#039;t tell your friends about it.\n\nOverall these videos aren?t quite as good as our first compilation (I&amp;#039;m exhausting my available resources), but since I secretly desire Sarah Ivanhoe (don?t tell Mook!) there?s some bias there.\n\n\n\nHave fun!\n\nMook &amp; Bee\n\n\nPS: Since the &quot;this has a virus&quot; comment is all the rage on Pirate Bay, let me assure you, with every well-stretched cell in my body, that I don&amp;#039;t even know where to find a virus let alone how to attach it to a DVD ISO.  Furthermore, I run anti-virus and firewalls so there&amp;#039;s little chance anything hopped on for the ride.  The project was compiled with NERO and converted to ISO with CD Burner XP.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:276b09444de5939aa69508016793bcbc6df39c35","amp;dn":"Yoga+Compilation+DVD+2+ISO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"276b09444de5939aa69508016793bcbc6df39c35","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,107,9,68,77,229,147,154,166,149,8,1,103,147,188,188,109,243,156,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
