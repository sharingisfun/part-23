The stories in this volume were selected from two Spanish language collections, Llamadas Telefonicas (1997), and Putas Asesinas (2001). The remaining stories in these two collections were later gathered in The Return.\n\nThe Collection Contains:\n\nSensini\n\nHenri Simon Leprince\n\nEnrique Martin \n\nA Literary Adventure\n\nPhone Calls\n\nThe Grub\n\nAnne Moore's Life\n\nMauricio (&quot;The Eye&quot;) Silva\n \nGomez Palacio\n\nLast Evenings on Earth\n\nDays of 1978\n\nVagabond in France and Belgium\n\nDentist\n\nDance Card\n\nSummary\n\nSet amid the diaspora of Chilean exiles in Latin America and Europe, the fourteen stories in Last Evenings on Earth are peopled by BolaÃƒÂ±o's beloved &quot;failed generation&quot; and demonstrate the complexities of and Latin American identity and history. The narrators are usually writers grappling with private (and often unlucky) quests, speaking in the first person as if giving a depositionÃ¢â‚¬â€like witnesses to a crime. These protagonists tend to take detours and narrate unresolved efforts. They are characters living at the margins. Other stories find themselves narrated in the third person by the author &quot;B.&quot;, which is one of many cases of BolaÃƒÂ±o writing himself into his own fiction.\n\nFor more books by Bolano see:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9779438/Roberto_Bolano_-_Novels__Poetry__amp__Essays_(17_books)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9779438/Roberto_Bolano_-_Novels__Poetry__amp__Essays_(17_books)&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBy workerbee\n\nThe torrent contains the book in PDF format.\nSeed!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4355691012340c1595aa556895648f08f327cab4","amp;dn":"Roberto+Bolano+-+Last+Evenings+on+Earth","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4355691012340c1595aa556895648f08f327cab4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,85,105,16,18,52,12,21,149,170,85,104,149,100,143,8,243,39,202,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
