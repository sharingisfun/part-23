Spencer showed no remorse for her crime and her full explanation for her actions was &quot;I don't like Mondays. This livens up the day&quot;.[ The song was first performed less than a month later. Geldof explained how he wrote the song:      I was doing a radio interview in Atlanta with Fingers and there was a telex machine beside me. I read it as it came out. Not liking Mondays as a reason for doing somebody in is a bit strange. I was thinking about it on the way back to the hotel and I just said 'Silicon chip inside her head had switched to overload'. I wrote that down. And the journalists interviewing her said, 'Tell me why?' It was such a senseless act. It was the perfect senseless act and this was the perfect senseless reason for doing it. So perhaps I wrote the perfect senseless song to illustrate it. It wasn't an attempt to exploit tragedy.  Geldof had originally intended the song as a B-side, but changed his mind after the song was successful with audiences on the Rats' US tour. Spencer's family tried unsuccessfully to prevent the single from being released in the United States. Despite being a major hit in the United Kingdom, it only reached #73 on the US Billboard Hot 100. The song was played regularly by album-oriented rock format radio stations in the United States throughout the 1980s, although radio stations in San Diego refrained from playing the track for some years in respect to local sensitivities about the shooting. The song became Number One in the UK single charts in July 1979. In the UK it won the Best Pop Song and Outstanding British Lyric categories at the Ivor Novello Awards.\nThe video, directed by David Mallet, was one of the first to have a narrative &quot;story&quot; to it.\n\nOriginal DVD Rip..................: Yes - only1joe\nOriginal Uploader................: Yes - only1joe\nUpload Speed.......................: 500kB/s\nMusic Genre.........................: Punk\nArtists Website(s)............... :\n\nYou can view the music video using VLC Player http://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html Ã¢â‚¬â€œ or choose your own player.\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n* * * I Will Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents * * *\n* * * This Is A Multi-Tracker Torrent Check Your Bit Torrent Client For A True Number Of Seeds * * *\n\n(*_*) Special thanks to Sketch6995 over at 1337x for letting me use his seed box for initial seeding after upload.\n\nMusic Video Media Info\n\nGeneral\nUnique ID.....................: 276020891763131146956577407510010472902 (0xCFA7B0A8942BC5EE0B0E7A45E08129C6)\nComplete name............: The Boomtown Rats - I Don't Like Mondays 1979.mkv\nFormat..........................: Matroska\nFormat version.............: Version 2\nFile size.........................: 169 MiB\nDuration........................: 3mn 56s\nOverall bit rate mode....: Variable\nOverall bit rate..............: 5 988 Kbps\nEncoded date.................: UTC 2013-10-04 18:47:21\nWriting application.......: MakeMKV v1.8.5 win(x86-release)\nWriting library...............: libmakemkv v1.8.5 (1.2.0/1.1.0) win(x86-release)\n\nVideo\nID................................................: 1\nFormat........................................: MPEG Video\nFormat version............................: Version 2\nFormat profile.............................: Main@Main\nFormat settings, BVOP...............: No\nFormat settings, Matrix.............: Custom\nCodec ID....................................: V_MPEG2\nCodec ID/Info...........................: MPEG 1 or 2 Video\nDuration....................................: 3mn 56s\nBit rate mode............................: Variable\nBit rate......................................: 5 677 Kbps\nMaximum bit rate......................: 9 800 Kbps\nWidth........................................: 720 pixels\nHeight.......................................: 576 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio...................: 4:3\nFrame rate mode.......................: Constant\nFrame rate.................................: 25.000 fps\nStandard....................................: PAL\nColor space................................: YUV\nChroma subsampling.................: 4:2:0\nBit depth....................................: 8 bits\nScan type...................................: Interlaced\nScan order.................................: Top Field First\nCompression mode....................: Lossy\nBits/(Pixel*Frame) ..................: 0.548\nTime code of first frame............: 11:34:15:12\nTime code source.......................: Group of pictures header\nStream size................................: 160 MiB (95%)\nLanguage...................................: English\nDefault.......................................: No\nForced........................................: No\n\nAudio\nID...............................................: 2\nFormat........................................: AC-3\nFormat/Info...............................: Audio Coding 3\nMode extension...........................: CM (complete main)\nFormat settings, Endianness.....: Big\nCodec ID.....................................: A_AC3\nDuration.....................................: 3mn 56s\nBit rate mode.............................: Constant\nBit rate.......................................: 192 Kbps\nChannel(s) ................................: 2 channels\nChannel positions......................: Front: L R\nSampling rate............................: 48.0 KHz\nBit depth....................................: 16 bits\nCompression mode.....................: Lossy\nStream size................................: 5.41 MiB (3%)\nTitle............................................: 2/0\nLanguage...................................: English\nDefault.......................................: Yes\nForced........................................: No","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bcb7ef517e9ccf1e8c4ca4f780bcc89b01f37dff","amp;dn":"The+Boomtown+Rats+-+I+Don%27t+Like+Mondays+1979+only1joe+MKV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bcb7ef517e9ccf1e8c4ca4f780bcc89b01f37dff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,183,239,81,126,156,207,30,140,76,164,247,128,188,200,155,1,243,125,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
