This affords readers a lot of creative freedom when it comes to marking verses, highlighting passages or playing back selected sections. There's even an option for making notes for each verse.\nThe Quran is divided up into 30 parts, each of which can be accessed easily.\nThe universal search function also proves to be useful; you can search for keywords or entire phrases.\nResults are listed in verses with markings denotating the beginning and end of a sentence.\nThere are some nice gimmicks to be found within the chapters, too. For instance, when reading verses, the verse numbers move as you scroll downwards, making it easy to know where you are. Move your fingers along the bar in order to jump to a specific verse.\nLots of language options are available. The original text is in Arabic and, if you like, you can have translations displayed in many languages.\nThe last major update of this app brought with it the so-called Tajweed reading option. For those of you who don't know, Tajweed is what the correct pronunciation of the holy texts is referred to as. The app iQuran Pro found a clever manner in which to communicate these phonetic rules:\nevery verse has certain passages that have to be pronounced in specific ways. These passages are highlighted, making them easier to read or rather enabling the reader to quickly ascertain which rule is to be applied.\nA legend of explanations of the colours/rules is provided.\nI found the playback feature to be top notch. There are eight reciters to choose from, which is a fun bonus. Verses are recited in order, and the app highlights the verse currently being read aloud so that you can follow along easily.\nCheck the bottom of the display for all of the usual playback buttons with which you can pause or skip, etc.\nThere are quite a few more options:\nDecide what happens when you reach the end of a chapter\nPlayback clusters of verses\nSelect how many times a verse is to be played back\nSwitch Tajweed assistance on/off\nDisplay/not Tajweed rules\nRegarding the first option, you can choose to play a chapter in a loop.\niQuran will also create groups of verses for you. This means only a certain amount of verses will be played back. This is a truly useful feature for users who are trying to learn passages off by heart.\nBottom line:\nI'm happy with iQuran Pro on the whole. It offers users a good amount of useful features and makes reading a lot of fun.\nMy major bone of contention with this application is that, is it's name indicated, it is an iOS Port. It's too bad the Android app wasn't adapted to Google or Android design guidelines. \n\n\n==========================================================\n==================== screenshot =========================\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.android-sooq.com/wp-content/uploads/Slider1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.android-sooq.com/wp-content/uploads/Slider1.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.android-sooq.com/wp-content/uploads/Slider2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.android-sooq.com/wp-content/uploads/Slider2.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.android-sooq.com/wp-content/uploads/Slide313.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.android-sooq.com/wp-content/uploads/Slide313.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.android-sooq.com/wp-content/uploads/Slide410.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.android-sooq.com/wp-content/uploads/Slide410.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.android-sooq.com/wp-content/uploads/Slide55.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.android-sooq.com/wp-content/uploads/Slide55.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.android-sooq.com/wp-content/uploads/Slide62.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.android-sooq.com/wp-content/uploads/Slide62.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6bde4503dd844dc2bec28db72443e0973f301a36","amp;dn":"iQuran+Pro+For+Android","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6bde4503dd844dc2bec28db72443e0973f301a36","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,222,69,3,221,132,77,194,190,194,141,183,36,67,224,151,63,48,26,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
