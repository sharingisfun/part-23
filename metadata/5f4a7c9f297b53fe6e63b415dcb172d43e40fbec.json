I havenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t seen this much rightwing frenzy over a Bill Clinton statement since Ã¢â‚¬Å“I did not have sex with that woman.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Both Dick Cheney and Ted Cruz have echoed Bill ClintonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s statements. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a big old red flag that you might have said the wrong thing! If youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re in public life, it should make you very worried if you make a statement that is not condemned by Dick Cheney and Ted Cruz, let alone a statement that is praised by them!\n\nThe official numbers for Obamacare enrollment are out, and they are not good. People tend to wait until the last minute to do things. Not as much at the US Congress waits until the last minute, but still pretty bad. But judging the response to Obamacare by the number who signed up in the first month is like judging how many people are going to file tax returns by looking at the number of people who filed in January.\n\nRush Limbaugh says that Obama is trying to lure young people into Obamacare with the promise of sexual promiscuity fueled by free contraception. I have yet to hear a good argument against Obamacare, but this has to be the worst one. Rush, if cake frosting was free, would you sit there eating can after can of it? Of course you would. OK, maybe thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not a good example. According to Rush Ã¢â‚¬Å“If you like your risky, promiscuous lifestyle, you can keep it. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s what Obama is promising.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Rush Limbaugh is a fine one to be lecturing people about their Ã¢â‚¬Å“riskyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ lifestyles. This is a man who lost his hearing due to use of narcotics. How many young people are so promiscuous that they go deaf from having sex?\n\nAnn Coulter has attacked the woman whose picture had been on the Obamacare website. If you wonder how a woman could do that to another woman, ask yourself again if Ann Coulter is really a woman. Ann said that the woman Ã¢â‚¬Å“is gonna have to make a sex tape to get her reputation back.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ A sex tape wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t work to get Ann CoulterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s reputation back, because I assume she says offensive things during sex, too.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f4a7c9f297b53fe6e63b415dcb172d43e40fbec","amp;dn":"Randi+Rhodes+Show+-+November+14+2013","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f4a7c9f297b53fe6e63b415dcb172d43e40fbec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,74,124,159,41,123,83,254,110,99,180,21,220,177,114,212,62,64,251,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
