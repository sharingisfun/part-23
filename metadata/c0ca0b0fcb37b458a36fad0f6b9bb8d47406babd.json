This sequel was later cut slightly, combined with the first story then released in English as Journey to the Lost City. Both halves were written by Thea von Harbou and the 1959 films are both directed by Fritz Lang, von Harbou&amp;#039;s former husband. In this continuation, Seetha (Debra Paget) and the architect Harald (Paul Hubschmid) have fallen in love. The biggest stumbling block to their romance is Chandra, the Maharaja of Eshnapur (Walther Reyer). He wants Seetha for himself. Because of that, the lovers fled from Eshnapur and are now being hunted by the Maharaja&amp;#039;s henchmen. That leads to inevitable killings, cruelties, and inhuman conduct until the Maharaja himself is the only one left who can right the situation.\n\n   General\n      Complete name : Das.Indische.Grabmal.1959.Lang.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      Format/Family : RIFF\n      File size : 1.33 GiB\n      PlayTime : 1h 41mn\n      Bit rate : 1875 Kbps\n      StreamSize : 12.2 MiB\n      Writing application : Nandub v1.0rc2\n      Writing library : Nandub build 1852/release\n   Video #0\n      Codec : XviD\n      Codec/Family : MPEG-4\n      Codec/Info : XviD project\n      Codec profile : Streaming Video Profile/Level 1\n      Codec settings/PacketBitStream : No\n      Codec settings/BVOP : Yes\n      Codec settings/QPel : No\n      Codec settings/GMC : 0\n      Codec settings/Matrix : Custom\n      PlayTime : 1h 41mn\n      Bit rate : 1798 Kbps\n      Width : 624 pixels\n      Height : 464 pixels\n      Display Aspect ratio : 4/3\n      Frame rate : 23.976 fps\n      Resolution : 8 bits\n      Chroma : 4:2:0\n      Interlacement : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.258\n      StreamSize : 1.27 GiB\n   Audio #1\n      Codec : MPEG-1 Audio layer 3\n      Codec profile : Joint stereo\n      PlayTime : 1h 41mn\n      Bit rate : 69 Kbps\n      Bit rate mode : VBR\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Sampling rate : 48 KHz\n      Resolution : 16 bits\n      StreamSize : 50.3 MiB\n      Writing library : LAME3.97b\n      Encoding settings : VBR (mtrh)\n\nPosted originally at Karagarga by mteste, who deserves the credits.\n\nEnglish subtitles available at opensubtitles.or","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c0ca0b0fcb37b458a36fad0f6b9bb8d47406babd","amp;dn":"Das.Indische.Grabmal.1959.Lang.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c0ca0b0fcb37b458a36fad0f6b9bb8d47406babd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,202,11,15,203,55,180,88,163,111,173,15,107,155,184,212,116,6,186,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
