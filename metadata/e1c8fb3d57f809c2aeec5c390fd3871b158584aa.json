It was re-released by the Trans-Siberian Orchestra, a side project of several Savatage members, on TSO&amp;#039;s 1996 debut album Christmas Eve and Other Stories. The piece describes a lone cello player playing a forgotten Christmas carol in war-torn Sarajevo.\n\n&quot;Christmas Eve/Sarajevo 12/24&quot; was also one of the songs featured on the Trans-Siberian Orchestra&amp;#039;s only (as of 2006) DVD, The Ghosts Of Christmas Eve, and is played twice at every live show: once as part of the Christmas Eve and Other Stories half of the show, and later as a finale. Along with &quot;Wizards In Winter&quot;, it is generally regarded as the TSO&amp;#039;s most recognizable recording.\n\nThe cellist that the story refers to is Vedran SmailoviÃƒâ€žÃ¢â‚¬Â¡. However, unlike the &quot;white-haired man&quot; referred to in the story, SmailoviÃƒâ€žÃ¢â‚¬Â¡ was in his mid-thirties at the time of the Siege of Sarajevo.\n\nThe song is often misnamed &quot;Carol of the Bells&quot; (due to its use of the melody) on file-sharing networks. As such, it has also been incorrectly linked to Metallica or Mannheim Steamroller (who themselves have several instrumental Christmas music hits, including its own rendition of Carol of the Bells) rather than accurately being attributed to either Savatage or the Trans-Siberian Orchestra.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e1c8fb3d57f809c2aeec5c390fd3871b158584aa","amp;dn":"Trans-Siberian+Orchestra+-+Christmas+Eve%2FSarajevo+12%2F24","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e1c8fb3d57f809c2aeec5c390fd3871b158584aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,200,251,61,87,248,9,194,174,236,92,57,15,211,135,27,21,133,132,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
