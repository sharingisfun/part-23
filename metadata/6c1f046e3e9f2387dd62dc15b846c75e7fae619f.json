Entering into a bargain with him wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be good either. Unfortunately, Taryn Warner, a latent wolf shifter, doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have many options open to her right now. Okay, she has no options. Basically it comes down to whether sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll do what it takes to escape the arranged mating with the sick SOB that her father set up. As the answer in this case is yes, it looks as though sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll have to agree to Trey ColemanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dealÃ¢â‚¬Â¦sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll have to mate with him instead. \n\nHaving always disliked shifter politics, Trey Coleman hadnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t bothered trying to form alliances with other packs. Now that his uncle Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a wolf with many alliances Ã¢â‚¬â€œ means to take TreyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s territory and his pack, he has no option but to form some alliances of his own very quickly or heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be easily outnumbered in the upcoming battle. He figures that the easiest way to do that would be to mate with a female whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Alpha is powerful and influential. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s only one problem with that Ã¢â‚¬â€œ he would then be stuck with her, and the last thing Trey wants is a mate. When he hears of TarynÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s situation, he offers her a deal Ã¢â‚¬â€œ if she falsely claims heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s her true mate and allows him to claim her, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll save her from her arranged mating and then let her leave after the battle with his uncle is over. \n\nSounds like a pretty straightforward deal...but soon Taryn and Trey realize they got more than they bargained for. Their mating instincts to protect and possess are weighing on them, they crave each otherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s touch and company, and their inner wolves donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t like it whenever theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re apart. Add in that theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll have to deal with this for an entire three months until the day of the battle finally arrives, and theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve got themselves a recipe for disaster Ã¢â‚¬â€œ or maybe for something quite the opposite. \n\nWarning: This novel contains an extremely sarcastic Alpha female, a broody possessive Alpha male, bitter in-laws, voyeuristic enforcers, a whole lot of dirty talk, and steamy bedroom battles for dominance. Reader Advisory: This book also contains a graphic mÃƒÂ©nage scene - not for the faint-hearted.\n\nBook 2: Wicked Cravings (The Phoenix Pack #2) by Suzanne Wright (April 16th 2013)\n\nDespite having been besotted with Dante Garcea since she was a child, wolf shifter Jaime Farrow figures that itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s time to move past the crush. If he wanted her, he wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have ignored her flirtatious behavior, right? Hiding her intense attraction to him isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t easy Ã¢â‚¬â€œ especially now that they're part of the same pack again Ã¢â‚¬â€œ but with bigger issues to worry about and with the submissive wolf act to maintain, Jaime is resolute on moving forward. Now if only the workaholic control-freak would let herÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nAs the pack Beta, Dante doesn't have the space or time in his life for a relationship. As such, he ignores his intense hunger for the willful Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and sometimes crazy Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Jaime. Yet when her flirtations abruptly end, Dante finds that he doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t like losing her attention. He finds something else too Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Jaime's hiding something. Determined to uncover her secret, he sets out to break through her defenses, even though being around her intensifies his cravings for her. What he finds is a problem that Jaime is convinced not even a powerful Beta can solve.\n\n\nSeed and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c1f046e3e9f2387dd62dc15b846c75e7fae619f","amp;dn":"The+Phoenix+Pack+Series+%281-2%29+by+Suzanne+Wright+%5BMU%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6c1f046e3e9f2387dd62dc15b846c75e7fae619f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,31,4,110,62,159,35,135,221,98,220,21,184,70,199,94,127,174,97,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
