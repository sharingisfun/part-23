Descended from a long line of graverobbers, they are determined to follow their family's footsteps to the fabled crypts of Gyptland. To get there, they will have to brave dangerous and unknown lands and keep company with all manner of desperate travelers-merchants, priests, and scoundrels alike. For theirs is a world both familiar and distant; a world of living saints and livelier demons, of monsters and madmen. \n\nThe Brothers Grossbart are about to discover that all legends have their truths, and worse fates than death await those who would take the red road of villainy.\n\n\n\n\nthe enterprise of death\n\nAs the witch-pyres of the Spanish Inquisition blanket Renaissance Europe in a moral haze, a young African slave finds herself the unwilling apprentice of an ancient necromancer. Unfortunately, quitting his company proves even more hazardous than remaining his pupil when she is afflicted with a terrible curse. Yet salvation may lie in a mysterious tome her tutor has hidden somewhere on the war-torn continent.\n\nShe sets out on a seemingly impossible journey to find the book, never suspecting her fate is tied to three strangers: the artist Niklaus Manuel Deutsch, the alchemist Dr. Paracelsus, and a gun-slinging Dutch mercenary. As Manuel paints her macabre story on canvas, plank, and church wall, the young apprentice becomes increasingly aware that death might be the least of her concerns.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:886cf561d699f7fa32fbffc5a17c6e39dc844dee","amp;dn":"Jesse+Bullington+-+2+novels","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"886cf561d699f7fa32fbffc5a17c6e39dc844dee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,108,245,97,214,153,247,250,50,251,255,197,161,124,110,57,220,132,77,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
