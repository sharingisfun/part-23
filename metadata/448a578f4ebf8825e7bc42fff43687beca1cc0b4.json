Records in North America. The live songs were recorded with guitarist Vivian Campbell during the first leg of the Sacred Heart tour. \n\nCraig Goldy replaced Campbell in mid-tour, and the band wanted something to represent the new line-up, so they recorded in studio the song &quot;Time to Burn&quot; with him, which was added to this album.\n\nMP3 - 320kbs\n  \t\nNo. \t\n1. \t&quot;King of Rock and Roll&quot; 3:24\n2. \t&quot;Rainbow in the Dark&quot;   6:10\n3. \t&quot;Sacred Heart&quot;          6:10\t\n4. \t&quot;Time to Burn&quot;   \t4:24\n5. \t&quot;Rock 'n' Roll Children&quot;/&quot;Long Live Rock'n'Roll&quot;/&quot;Man on the Silver Mountain&quot; 9:38\n6. \t&quot;We Rock&quot;        \t4:34\n\n\nPlease Dont Hit And Run !\n\nAnd Please Feel free to Comment, Reguest and tell me what you like :D","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:448a578f4ebf8825e7bc42fff43687beca1cc0b4","amp;dn":"Dio+-+%281986%29+Intermission+EP+%5B320kbs%5D+%7E%7ERenovatio%7E%7E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"448a578f4ebf8825e7bc42fff43687beca1cc0b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,138,87,143,78,191,136,37,231,188,66,255,244,54,135,190,202,28,192,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
