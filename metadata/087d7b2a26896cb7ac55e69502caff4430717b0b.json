These objectives have been retained in the second edition but a slight shift in emphasis gives the volume an overall perspective that is more forward looking.\n\nStructured into 11 chapters, the current edition is a thorough revision of the original, covering the principles of inductively coupled plasmas, instrumentation, methodology and applications within environmental analysis, earth science, food science and clinical medicine. Each chapter, written by internationally recognised leaders in their specific subject areas, provides enough detail to be useful to both the new and experienced users. Full account is taken of recent developments, such as high resolution instruments, novel detection systems and electrospray techniques.\n\nWritten for all analytical scientists but particularly those involved in atomic spectroscopy and in environmental, geochemical, clinical or food analysis, this timely and informative book will be an essential reference in their use of inductively coupled plasmas to achieve their own scientific goals","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:087d7b2a26896cb7ac55e69502caff4430717b0b","amp;dn":"Inductively+Coupled+Plasma+Spectrometry+and+its+Applications+2nd","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"087d7b2a26896cb7ac55e69502caff4430717b0b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,125,123,42,38,137,108,183,172,85,230,149,2,202,255,68,48,113,123,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
