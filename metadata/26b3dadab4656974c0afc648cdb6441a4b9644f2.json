I bring you 105 issues to plug into your EP collection. While most of these are mags that weren't in the first torrent, you'll find a few repeats in which I'm replacing partial scans with complete ones. And as an extra special cloacal bonus, I've included the recent book that celebrates these artistic monstrosities, &quot;The Weird World of Eerie Publications&quot;, written by Mike Howlett, with a forward by Steve Bissette.\n\nAs always, mucho thanks to the people who garnered a paycheck for schlepping out these stories (aka, Creative Teams) and to the brave souls who risked eyesight and sanity to scan them for us. Please seed and keep this top-notch (chortle) product alive for future, inbred generations!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:26b3dadab4656974c0afc648cdb6441a4b9644f2","amp;dn":"Eerie+Publications+%28fills%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"26b3dadab4656974c0afc648cdb6441a4b9644f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,179,218,218,180,101,105,116,192,175,198,72,205,182,68,26,75,150,68,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
