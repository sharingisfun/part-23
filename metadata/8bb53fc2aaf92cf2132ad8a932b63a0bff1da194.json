Grant and Joel Grey\n\nStanding out in the crowded field of screen adaptations of the classic Dickens novel A Christmas Carol is hard to do, but this version pulls it off. When a transparent Jacob Marley walks through Ebenezer Scrooge's apartment door, you know you're seeing something both timeless and contemporary. Other strategically placed special effects--a funnel cloud that transports Scrooge and the ghost of Christmas present, the hollow specter of Christmas future--keep you riveted without slipping into anachronism. \nBut, as good as the technology is, the performances are what really power this 93-minute TNT interpretation. Patrick Stewart brings a depth to Scrooge that allows the character to go beyond the cartoonish qualities that have made him a Christmas mainstay. That doesn't mean he's any less heartless with his hapless employee Bob Cratchit (Richard E. Grant) or any less dismissive of his well-meaning nephew. A frail-looking Joel Grey makes an excellent ghost of Christmas past, and a superb British cast ably fill the remaining roles","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8bb53fc2aaf92cf2132ad8a932b63a0bff1da194","amp;dn":"A+Christmas+Carol+%28+TV+1999+w%2FPatrick+Stewart%29+DVD+.iso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8bb53fc2aaf92cf2132ad8a932b63a0bff1da194","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,181,63,194,170,249,44,242,19,42,216,169,50,182,58,11,255,29,161,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
