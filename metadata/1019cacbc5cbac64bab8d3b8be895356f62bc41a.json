It is the first game in the Empire Earth series. It has been described as very similar to the Age of Empires series, and received positive reviews.\n\nThe game requires players to collect resources to construct buildings, produce citizens, and conquer opposing civilizations. Empire Earth spans 500,000 years of world history, which is divided into 14 epochs, beginning with the prehistoric age, and ending with the nano age.\n\nAn expansion pack was developed by Mad Doc Software called Empire Earth: The Art of Conquest, which was released on September 17, 2002. It added new features such as a special power for each civilization, and a new 15th epoch, entitled the Space Age, which focuses on the colonization of space planets.\n\n\nSYSTEM REQUIREMENTS\nMinimum System Requirements\nOS: Windows 98/ME/2000/XP\nProcessor: Pentium 2 @ 333 MHz\nMemory: 64 MB\nVideo Memory: 4 MB\nSound Card: DirectX Compatible\nDirectX: 8.1\nKeyboard &amp; Mouse\nCD/DVD Rom Drive\n\nRecommended System Requirements\nOS: Windows 98/ME/2000/XP\nProcessor: Pentium 3 @ 600 MHz\nMemory: 128 MB\nVideo Memory: 32 MB\nSound Card: DirectX Compatible\nDirectX: 8.1\nKeyboard &amp; Mouse","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1019cacbc5cbac64bab8d3b8be895356f62bc41a","amp;dn":"Empire+Earth+plus+AoC+Portable+-+%5BEspera%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1019cacbc5cbac64bab8d3b8be895356f62bc41a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,25,202,203,197,203,172,100,186,184,211,184,190,137,83,86,246,43,196,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
