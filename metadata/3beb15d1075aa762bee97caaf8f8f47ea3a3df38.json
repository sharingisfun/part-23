It ranges in genres from Contemporary to Metal, from Hip-Hop to Southern Gospel, from Indie to Alternative, from Worship to Bluegrass, well you get the idea.  And it's your chance to sample a wide variety of current music with a Christian message.\n\nAll totaled, we're now up to 812 releases on the year, nearing my goal of sharing 1000 by the end of 2012.  And there's some great albums in today's 31st bundle.  Tamela Mann brings her gospel/soul to light with the release of &quot;Best Days&quot;, which is perhaps her finest music to date.  Hip-Hop artists Heath McNease has a couple of new releases, including one inspired by the ever popular novelist, CS Lewis.  Pro has decided to change his name to &quot;Derek Minor&quot; in releasing his third Volume of the PSA series.  Female blues guitarist and singer Rory Block has paid tribute to the late Rev Gary Davis with her release of &quot;I Belong To The Band.&quot;  Israel And New Breed have a great new release.  And if Southern Gospel interests you, there's a new &quot;Ultimate Southern Gospel Classics&quot; by Various Artists in this bundle.\n\nMore specifically, the 24 titles in this 31th bundle today include...\n\n * Advance Base - 2012 - A Shut-In's Prayer\n * As I Lay Dying - 2012 - Cauterize - Single\n * Brandi Carlile - 2012 - Bear Creek\n * Chimene Badi - 2012 - Chimene Badi Gospel And Soul\n * David Archuleta - 2012 - Begin\n * Disciple - 2012 - Draw The Line - Single\n * For Today - 2012 - Fearless - Single\n * Heath McNease - 2012 - The Weight Of Glory - Songs Inspired By CS Lewis\n * Heath McNease - 2012 - Thrift Store Jesus\n * Heta Himlen - 2012 - The Jellyrox\n * Israel And New Breed - 2012 - Jesus At The Center\n * Kady Danger - 2012 - Payphone - Single\n * Ken Kenx - 2012 - Mixed Feelings\n * Luther Dickinson - 2012 - Hambone's Meditations\n * Matthew Perryman Jones - 2012 - Land Of The Living\n * Mutemath - 2012 - Odd Soul - Live In DC\n * New River Bluegrass - 2012 - Heart On The Run\n * Plumb - 2012 - Need You Now - Single\n * Pro - 2012 - PSA Volume 3 - Who Is Derek Minor\n * Rory Block - 2012 - I Belong To The Band - A Tribute To Rev Gary Davis\n * Tamela Mann - 2012 - Best Days\n * Various - 2012 - Rhymes And Reason, Vol 2\n * Various - 2012 - Ultimate Southern Gospel Classics\n * We Shot The Moon - 2012 - Love And Fear\n\nGod Bless,\nTorrentTracts - August 2012\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3beb15d1075aa762bee97caaf8f8f47ea3a3df38","amp;dn":"2012+-+The+Year+In+Christian+Music+%28Bundle+31+of+31%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3beb15d1075aa762bee97caaf8f8f47ea3a3df38","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,235,21,209,7,90,167,98,190,233,124,170,248,248,244,126,163,163,223,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
