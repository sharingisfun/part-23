It was directed and produced by Robert Townsend, and written by Robert Townsend, Keenen Ivory Wayans, and Dom Irrera (uncredited). Comedians featured in this film include Robert Townsend, Keenen Ivory Wayans, Damon Wayans, Dom Irrera, Don Reed, and John Witherspoon. Many of the cast and crew later became involved in the Fox TV sketch comedy series In Living Color (1990ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“1994), and the style of humor is similar.\n\nStoryline:\nThe movie focuses on Bobby (Townsend) and his quest to succeed as a Hollywood actor. He is stuck working at a fast-food stand with some hilarious and demented characters who consistently try to destroy his plans for the future.\n\nWhen he finally gets a break, he is forced to question his own morality. Should he join the system and play stereotypical roles? Or should he refuse, risking his dream of becoming an actor?\n\nAs he travels, he frequently has terrifying visions of the consequences of playing stereotypes. In one vision, Bobby is a detective pursuing a murderer with a Jheri curl. In another, he is Uncle Tom with an angry mob after him. Yet another vision shows Bobby in an audition for an Eddie Murphy type, while a final vision shows Bobby playing a King in a Shakespearean play.\n\nOne of the film's vignettes involves a parody of Siskel and Ebert's television show, Sneakin' in at the Movies. Featured are two African-Americans, Speed and my homie, Tyrone who bump into each other at a movie theater. They review movies using street dialect; while reviewing Amadeus and Salerius, Speed's entire review consists of yelling &quot;Bullshit&quot; at the screen. When the two disagree about the movie Chicago Jones and the Temple of Doom, Tyrone threatens Speed with the words, &quot;Im'o bust yo' ass&quot;. They disapprove of Dirty Larry; instead of giving it a thumbs-down, the two give it the finger. Finally, the duo give lavish praise and a high five to the film Attack of the Killer Street Pimps. The vignette ends when Speed and Tyrone are caught sneaking into the theater and ejected.\n\nHollywood Shuffle was produced on a very tight budget. Townsend personally financed the movie with his own credit cards, and, in order to avoid obtaining permits, he asked his crew to wear college sweatshirts to pose as students.\n\nThe film's trailer (included on the MGM DVD release), which is hosted by Townsend, jokes about the lack of funds. As the trailer ends, Townsend begs the audience to see the film as the set's furniture is repossessed. The trailer ends as Townsend is forced to use a disposable lighter when the electricity is turned off.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nHollywood Shuffle (1987) Related links(excluding imdb's since it's already listed): \n\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood_Shuffle&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood_Shuffle&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n       \n\n\n               My hours for seeding are 10am or 12pm----11pm or 12am (Central Time) because i don't have any fancy gadgets to seed for you guys when i turn off my comp.\n\n            thanks all, i am open to requests(if good taste) so comment and i'll see what i can do. ---Antula\n\n\n        We give &quot;Dirty Larry&quot; the finger! \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c1f2d1407fd931fd44664eac6a470b3ebc516327","amp;dn":"Hollywood+Shuffle","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c1f2d1407fd931fd44664eac6a470b3ebc516327","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,242,209,64,127,217,49,253,68,102,78,172,106,71,11,62,188,81,99,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
