His technical\n\nability with the slide trombone enabled it to take a place in the front line\n\nwith jazz soloing instruments like the trumpet and saxophones in the daunting\n\nBeBop &quot;idiom.&quot;\n\n\n\n    This upload comprises (2) distinct volumes of the EMINENT JAY JAY JOHNSON\n\n    on BLUE NOTE\n\n\n\n    Volume #1 is an RVG (Rudy Van Gelder) reissue (2001)\n\n\n    Volume #2 is a plain old Blue Note digitization (1989)\n\n\n\n\nInteresting trivial note:  Volume #2 booklet says that Wynton Kelly was born\n\nin Jamaica and the booklet notes from my previous upload says he was born in\n\nBrooklyn.
