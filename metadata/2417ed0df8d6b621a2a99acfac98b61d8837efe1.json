I compared it to the one I had before and found it to be ever so slightly better but I honestly donÃ‚Â´t think at all that this is a mastertape, I also havenÃ‚Â´t a clue why I should keep it to myself since this show has been making the rounds for years. I remember some talk a while back about a real master that was supposed to blow any other versions away, but so far nothing has been released. I have heard numerous versions of this show through the years and this is the best IÃ‚Â´ve heard. If anyone has a better version, or that elsuive master, please post it for everyoneÃ‚Â´s enjoyment as a reminder of how good this band was.\n\n1. Deuce\n2. Cold gin\n3. NothinÃ‚Â´ to lose\n4. Firehouse\n5. Let me know\n6. 100,000 years (with rare 4th verse)\n7. Black diamond\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2417ed0df8d6b621a2a99acfac98b61d8837efe1","amp;dn":"Kiss+-+New+York%2C+NY+31-12-1973+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2417ed0df8d6b621a2a99acfac98b61d8837efe1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,23,237,13,248,214,182,33,162,169,154,207,172,152,182,29,136,55,239,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
