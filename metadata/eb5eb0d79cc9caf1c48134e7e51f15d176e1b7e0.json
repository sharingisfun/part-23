It includes articles that are extensions of papers included in the first conference on Rough Sets and Intelligent Systems Paradigms.\n\nThe 26 papers presented in this volume introduce a number of new advances in the foundations and applications of artificial intelligence, engineering, image processing, logic, mathematics, medicine, music, and science.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb5eb0d79cc9caf1c48134e7e51f15d176e1b7e0","amp;dn":"Transactions+on+Rough+Sets+IX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb5eb0d79cc9caf1c48134e7e51f15d176e1b7e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,94,176,215,156,201,202,241,196,129,52,231,229,31,21,209,118,225,183,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
