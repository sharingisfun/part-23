But when you lose control of your anger, it can get in the way of meaningful relationships, successful careers, and ultimately, feelings of happiness and enjoyment.\r\n\r\nIn this highly anticipated book, renowned mindfulness expert and author of Calming Your Anxious Mind Jeff Brantley offers a breakthrough approach using mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) and compassion practices to help you better handle the anger, fear, and hostile emotions that can wreak havoc at home, work, and in relationships. In addition, you will also learn important self-awareness skills to help you stop overreacting and improve communication with others.\r\n\r\nWhile other self-help books focus on traditional anger management, Brantley offers solutions that give you personal control over the experience of anger in your life. Inside, youâ€™ll discover the three major meditative approaches to soothing anger: stabilizing mind and body through concentrating your attention mindfully; using compassionate attention and reflection to disarm the energy of your anger; and learning to use wise understanding about the impermanent and â€œconditionedâ€ nature of your angry reactions in order to diminish your vulnerability to angerâ€™s power.\r\n\r\nIf you have difficulty with anger, you may be quick to blame others or act in aggressive ways. Unfortunately, this kind of thinking can often leave you feeling alone, alienated, and unhappy. If you are ready to make real, lasting changes, this book can provide you with the skills needed to manage and and transform your anger so that you can live a happier, healthier life","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a974970c1b1bbd78e0ea07714515bbe5395de64","amp;dn":"Calming+Your+Angry+Mind+-+Jeffrey+Brantley","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a974970c1b1bbd78e0ea07714515bbe5395de64","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,151,73,112,193,177,187,215,142,14,160,119,20,81,91,190,83,149,222,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
