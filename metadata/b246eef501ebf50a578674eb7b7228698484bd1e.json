Here is the real one. \n    \n    INFO:\n    \n    MINDTHEGAP is living up to its groupname. We do mind all\n    the gaps in archives out there. If we see a rerun airing\n    of unreleased eps from series we try to get it. If the\n    show is really old and the hope of finding the original\n    release is gone, we try to fix that too with iNTERNALs. \n    \n    This of course makes our releases a bit random and some\n    might think we are mad but there will be a reason behind\n    the madness.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b246eef501ebf50a578674eb7b7228698484bd1e","amp;dn":"Comedy.Central.Presents.S06E07.Nick.DiPaolo.REAL.PDTV.XviD-MiNDT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b246eef501ebf50a578674eb7b7228698484bd1e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,70,238,245,1,235,245,10,87,134,116,235,123,114,40,105,132,132,189,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
