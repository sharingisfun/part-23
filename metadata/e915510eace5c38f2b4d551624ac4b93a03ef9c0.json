Session\n13. Numb\n\n\nNotes:  I love the older Linkin Park stuff and I thought Minutes to Midnight was good but other then that they have lost their touch with the sound that made them great from the beginning.  Because of this I will only upload Meteora, Hybrid Theory, and Minutes to Midnight.  If I feel I recieve enough request for the other albums I will rip/encode them and up but I doubt it will happen.  For now enjoy this awesome album in the best possible quality you can find.\n\nSeed and comment on quality please.  As other great uploaders have noted, the \n+ and - function is worthess on open sites/trackers.  So don't be shy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e915510eace5c38f2b4d551624ac4b93a03ef9c0","amp;dn":"Linkin+Park+-+Meteora+%28iTunes%29+%2ATyMoD%2A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e915510eace5c38f2b4d551624ac4b93a03ef9c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,21,81,14,172,229,195,143,43,77,85,22,36,172,75,147,160,62,249,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
