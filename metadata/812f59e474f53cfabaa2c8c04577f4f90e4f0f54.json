Previously, he -- either with or without Art Garfunkel -- released albums recorded at massive venues like Madison Square Garden or Central Park, but Hear Music's 2012 Live in New York City -- available either as a two-CD/one-DVD set or simply as a double CD or single DVD -- was recorded at the comparatively intimate Webster Hall and, appropriately enough, the performance feels comparatively cozy, Simon striking just the right blend of playing for himself and playing for the audience. He showcases a nice chunk of So Beautiful or So What -- &quot;Dazzling Blue,&quot; &quot;So Beautiful or So What,&quot; &quot;Rewrite,&quot; &quot;The Afterlife,&quot; roughly half of the album -- and about half of Graceland, often opting for album tracks over hits (no &quot;You Can Call Me Al&quot; or &quot;Graceland,&quot; but &quot;That Was Your Mother&quot; and &quot;Gumboots&quot; both make the cut), and when he does dip into such standards as &quot;50 Ways to Leave Your Lover,&quot; &quot;Mother and Child Reunion,&quot; &quot;Slip Slidin' Away,&quot; and &quot;Still Crazy,&quot; he finds subtle little ways to inject a bit of groove into their well-worn contours. Simon is pleasing the crowd without pandering, and he winds up with a live album that's lively, slightly surprising, warm, and undeniably fun.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       Tracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n   1.
