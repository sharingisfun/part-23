The series writer, Peter Arnett, was an Associated Press reporter in Vietnam from 1962 to 1975. Maclear visited Vietnam during the production of the series and had access to film material there. He was the first Western journalist allowed to visit that area since the end of the war.\nThe series aired in Canada on CBC Television, in the United States and in the United Kingdom on Channel 4. CBC aired only 18 of the episodes during the 1980-81 season because the series production was incomplete. The remaining episodes were broadcast during CBC's 1981-82 season. In the US, The documentary series was remastered and consolidated into 13 one hour long episodes By NBC for American television syndication. The Series was released in the UK during the 1984-85 season aired by Channel 4.\n\nThe series was released on videocassette format by Embassy Entertainment, in 1987 and  Bonneville Worldwide Entertainment, in 1998. It won a National Education Association award for best world documentary.  The series was released on DVD By Image Entertainment in 2000 and by Time-Life/Star Vista/VSC in 2013.\n\nVietnam: The Ten Thousand Day War is considered by many as the definitive documentary on The Vietnam conflict. Very broad in scope, some consider it too broad complaining that it doesn't go into enough depth to be considered as a great documentary. In my opinion considering the plethora of documentaries that have come out about Vietnam, this is the only one that give you complete coverage of that 30 year long war. From it's roots in the Japanese occupation of Indochina before WWII to final end in 1975, no other documentary explores the basis and genesis of the war like this one does. It doesn't give an opinion, but allows other to state their opinions so you the viewer can judge the validity of those opinions. The lack of commentary will turn some off, but I find it refreshing to hear those people who were actually there give their ideals  and understandings. It helps you understand the rights and wrongs. Ho Chi Minh was asked after the Japanese surrender, by the US representative, what he wanted from the US government. His answer? NOTHING, given sitting down at the table with a copy of the US Constitution in his hands. An honest appraisal of the war of Vietnamese independence. If I had to recommend a Vietnam documentary to someone, I would recommend this one, the full 26 episode version, not the cut down 13 episode version.\n\nThis release comes from my rip of the 2013 CSC Video 4 disc DVD set, It is coded in x264 and AAC sound at 960x720p (4x3) resolution. It is in full color as shown on TV broadcast back in 1980-85 and I have done no alteration to the video or sound..\n\nTet!  \n\n\n\nAired, CBC,  December 10, 1980; UK Channel 4, February 25, 1985\n\nEpisode Fifteen covers the Tet Offensive. January '68, The Viet Cong attack throughout the country all at once. Almost every US installation sees some sort of assault. Television brings the attack to the living rooms of every American household. Two years since the involvement of ground troops in the war, the prevailing opinion was that the US was winning the war. The North decides to attack. 80.000 Viet Minh troops infiltrate the south led by the South Vietnamese communists known as the Viet Cong. They even penetrated the US embassy and set it afire. 4,000 Northern troops are fighting in Saigon itself. Casualties are heavy with no sign of ceasing. South Vietnamese cities are destroyed, one US army officer states on TV that &quot;We had to destroy it to save it.&quot; For the first time the Viet Minh come out and fight a pitched land battle, they quickly take the provincial capital Hue from the South's troops. US Marines supported by tanks take it back throwing the Vietminh out and driving them back across the border but not without heavy casualties in hard street fighting. Both sides consider it a victory. For the South and US a tactical victory, for the North a strategic one. It was clear that the war was far from won. LBJ now sees the war as unwinnable and believes withdrawal as the only solution. He views the war as having  destroyed his presidency and decides to not seek re-election.\n\nTechnical Specs (Ep 01)\n\nVideo Codec:         : AVC\nVideo Bitrate:       : 3,233 kbps\nVideo Aspect Ratio:  : 1.33, (4x3)\nVideo Resolution:    : 960x720\nScan type            : Progressive\nAudio Codec:         : AAC LC\nAudio language:      : English\nAudio Bitrate:       : 192 kbps\nAudio Channels:      : 2 (stereo)\nRun-Time:            : 52 mn\nFramerate:           : 29.970 fps\nNumber of Parts:     : 1\nContainer            : MP4\nPart Size:           : 1.25 GiB\n\nTechnical Specs (Ep 02 thru 26)\n\nVideo Codec:         : AVC\nVideo Bitrate:       : 3,226 kbps\nVideo Aspect Ratio:  : 1.33, (4x3)\nVideo Resolution:    : 960x720\nScan type            : Progressive\nAudio Codec:         : AAC LC\nAudio language:      : English\nAudio Bitrate:       : 192 kbps\nAudio Channels:      : 2 (stereo)\nRun-Time:            : 26 mn\nFramerate:           : 29.970 fps\nNumber of Parts:     : 25\nContainer            : MP4\nPart Size:           : 641 MiB\nSource:              : DVD-rip\nEncoded date         : 2014-10-21\nEncoded by:          : Egilman","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7af8f5b50d1f2b2166d6d50c10eef7538408ce56","amp;dn":"Vietnam+The+10%2C000+Day+War+15of26+Tet%21+720p+Egilman","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7af8f5b50d1f2b2166d6d50c10eef7538408ce56","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,248,245,181,13,31,43,33,102,214,213,12,16,238,247,83,132,8,206,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
