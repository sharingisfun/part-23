It details the claims of thirty-three such Ã¢â‚¬Å“Lone Survivors.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nBecause of the extraordinary nature of CusterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Last Stand, extraordinary confirmation should be required of the account when assessing the validity of any claim to survivorship. If someone is able to reproduce the elements of the fight, it does not qualify them to the distinction of having lived through the event. There must be corroborating testimony, either by another person or through descriptions of an event that are undeniably accurate and largely consistent with other accounts of the battle.\n\n-----\n\nFrom publisher","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:14a9cad26291919f641135e305276a2c3ffd9a9b","amp;dn":"Custer+Survivors+101%2C+v2+By+Ethan+Harris+%28mobi%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"14a9cad26291919f641135e305276a2c3ffd9a9b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,169,202,210,98,145,145,159,100,17,53,227,5,39,106,44,63,253,154,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
