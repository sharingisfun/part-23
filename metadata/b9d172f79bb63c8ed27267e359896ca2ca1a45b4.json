They actually started long before the Beatles, but it wasn't until after the Liverpool quartet hit that they saw any success in England or America. Their biggest British success was a version of the Contours' &quot;Do You Love Me,&quot; but the hottest number on their first album was a searing (by British standards) rendition of &quot;I Want Candy,&quot; later popularized by the Strangeloves, whose Bo Diddley-based beat, Bob Porter and company handled with admirable style. Poole later faded into obscurity, while the Tremeloes achieved success on their own.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-tremeloes-p442664/biography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-tremeloes-p442664/biography&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Page: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/ultimate-collection-castle-r175219&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/ultimate-collection-castle-r175219&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
