His sound has taken in many different influences and becomes a hybrid of intense industrial rhythmic programming with meldoramatic songwriting that takes you on a journey exploring each layer and each corner of the musical idea and developing into a mad cacophany of bouncing opera-core. You will either love it or hate it.\n\nThis album is absolutely fucking amazing.\n\n[b]Tracklist:[/b]\n01.Gurnitujr\t\t \t \t\n02.Ok You Win\t\t\t\t\n03.Dirtspiller\t\t\t\t\n04.Keep Yr Eyes Peeled\t\t\n05.The Only\t\n06.IN FLOOD\t\n07.A Beginning","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3baf57c3df8dca397735b83e447020e98d21d2d0","amp;dn":"Severn+-+A+Beginning+EP+%282008%29+%5BMP3-V0%5D%5Bcxcr6-003%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3baf57c3df8dca397735b83e447020e98d21d2d0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,175,87,195,223,141,202,57,119,53,184,62,68,112,32,233,141,33,210,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
