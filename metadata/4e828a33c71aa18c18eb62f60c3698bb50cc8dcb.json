The first was\nenclosed originally in the Freddie Mercury Solo Collection, and the second was\nreleased seperately, in the Lover of Life, Singer of Songs DVD.\n\nThe main differences are the 30 seconds which open the second release, not\navailable in the first, and the inclusion of subtitles.  That's what made me\nchoose the second release when completing the upload of this series.\n\nTherefore, you have here a subpack including subtitles in English, French,\nGerman, Italian, Spanish, Nederlands, and Portuguese.\n\nEnjoy it.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is intended to be played on a PC or a HTPC.

There just seems to be a \nhuge chunk of the man's life; his rock star idol image as the frontman of Queen, \nmainly; left out. Of course, filmmakers Rudi Dolenzal and Hannes Rosacher are \nconcentrating on the man here, not Queen.\n\nJumping around in time and difficult to follow, this documentary covers \nFreddie's birth in Tanzania (where he was named Farrokh Bulsara) to his time in \nan Indian boarding school as a teenager. Much delight for fans can be gleaned \nwhen rare drawings by Mercury are shown. The flamboyant singer also flirted with \nfashion design and many of these images, including drawings and a few actual \ngarments, are also shown.\n\nSome time into his late teenage years, Freddie formed a band at school called \nThe Hectics and then later, when in London, joined the band Smile which \neventually evolved into Queen. Again, there is some interesting recreations and \nrecorded material used to tell this part of the story.\n\nBut the real interesting stuff here is the interviews with Mercury's &quot;wife,&quot; a \nfemale whom he lived with for 6 years and eventually came out to, and his final \nmale lover whom Mercury often introduced as &quot;my husband.&quot; The film does not get \n&quot;seedy&quot; and really delve into Mercury's sexual peccadillos, however it does show \nvideo footage of Mercury's debauched 39th birthday which apparently went on for \nweeks.\n\nFinally, mention must be made of the segment with opera diva Montserrat Caballe \nwhich shows Mercury's wonderful and imaginative musicianship. The interview with \nCaballe reflects her deep love for him and through her we are touched by \nMercury's marvellous spirit and creativity.\n\n&quot;Freddie Mercury: The Untold Story&quot; brings forth images and interviews that the \nmost diehard Queen fan will never have seen before. But at 68 minutes, the film \nonly glosses over the man's life and legacy. Very little coverage of his \nwonderful musical work with Queen is really included and no mention of the \n&quot;tribute&quot; concert in his honor following his death is made. This, quite simply, \nis only a slice of the pie. \n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGeneral\nFormat                           : AVI\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                        : 1.37 GiB\nDuration                         : 1h 52mn\nOverall bit rate                 : 1 745 Kbps\nWriting application              : FairUse Wizard - http://fairusewizard.com\nWriting library                  : The best and REALLY easy backup tool\n\nVideo\nFormat                           : AVC\nFormat/Info                      : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile                   : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;f9b1909e91b9b5ccd7c8&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nFormat settings, CABAC           : Yes\nFormat settings, ReFrames        : 3 frames\nCodec ID                         : H264\nDuration                         : 1h 52mn\nBit rate                         : 1 287 Kbps\nWidth                            : 720 pixels\nHeight                           : 512 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 1.406\nFrame rate                       : 25.000 fps\nResolution                       : 24 bits\nColorimetry                      : 4:2:0\nScan type                        : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.140\nStream size                      : 1.01 GiB (74%)\nWriting library                  : x264 core 58 svn-736bm\n\nAudio\nFormat                           : AC-3\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Coding 3\nCodec ID                         : 2000\nDuration                         : 1h 52mn\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 448 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nChannel positions                : L R\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nStream size                      : 359 MiB (26%)\nAlignment                        : Split accross interleaves\nInterleave, duration             : 40 ms (1.00 video frame)\nInterleave, preload duration     : 500 ms\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is a part of the 10cd+2DVD box The Freddie Mercury Solo Collection\n\nPart I: The Albums\n         CD01 Mr. Bad Guy\n         CD02 Barcelona\n\nPart II: The Singles\n         CD04 The Singles 1973-1985\n         CD05 The Singles 1986-1993\n\nPart III: Rarities\n         CD06 Rarities I (Mr. Bad Guy Sessions)\n         CD07 Rarities II (Barcelona Sessions)\n         CD08 Rarities III (Other Sessions)\n\nPart IV: Remixes, Instrumentals and Interviews\n         CD03 The Great Pretender\n         CD09 Instrumentals\n         CD10 David Wigg Interviews\n\nPart V: The Video Collection (H.264/AC3 DVDRip)\n\nPart VI: The Untold Story (H.264/AC3 DVDRip)\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e828a33c71aa18c18eb62f60c3698bb50cc8dcb","amp;dn":"Freddie+Mercury+-+The+Solo+Collection+Part+VI+%28The+Untold+Story%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e828a33c71aa18c18eb62f60c3698bb50cc8dcb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,130,138,51,199,26,161,140,24,235,98,246,12,54,152,187,80,204,141,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
