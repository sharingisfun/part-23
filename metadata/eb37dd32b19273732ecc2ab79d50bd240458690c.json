ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a small town and memories are long, and Katie and JennyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s husband, Chief of Police Jake Robbins, have had to work at putting the tragedy behind them. But it's all brought up again in the wake of a hurricane which has just wreaked havoc on their quiet Maine town. Since its founding, Wilton has had a quaint tradition of creating a time capsule every fifty years, and the storm unearthed the most recent capsule. As the editor of the local paper, Katie joins Chief Robbins to supervise its opening. Neither of them is prepared for the macabre set of predictions, dating back to months before JennyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s murder, that they find inside. Someone predicted her death, as well as eleven other tragedies, which are still occurring even long after the death of KatieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s husband.\n\nAt last, after all these years, Katie has reason to hope that her husband might not have been guilty of JennyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s murder after all. But as she and Jake race to stop the next predictions from coming true, they find themselves caught in a terrifying mind game with no rulesÃ¢â‚¬Â¦and life or death consequences.\n\nIn Without Warning, David Rosenfelt has written another tightly plotted thriller that will hold readers in its grip from the opening page all the way through to the stunning conclusion.\n\nFull Retail. ePub and Calibre reader ready.
