He changed the way humans view their place in\nnature. His explanation of the evolutionary process occurring\nthrough natural selection forms the basis of modern-day biological\nsciences, including the applied disciplines of agriculture,\nmedicine, and, most recently, biotechnology.\nThere have been hundreds of books and articles about the\nlife and times of this great man, and I obviously cannot cover\neverything there is to know in one short book. If you can read\nonly one Darwin book, I highly recommend the 1991 biography\nby Adrian Desmond and James Moore; if you can manage\ntwo, add DarwinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s autobiography. Here, I aim to present\na more personal look at Darwin the man.\n\nSEED PLEASE,","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c4f8acca482fc0d6f0efc29bf8f031dd4991ff8c","amp;dn":"Charles+Darwin+-+Tim+M.+Berra+%5BRESEED%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c4f8acca482fc0d6f0efc29bf8f031dd4991ff8c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,248,172,202,72,47,192,214,240,239,194,155,248,240,49,221,73,145,255,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
