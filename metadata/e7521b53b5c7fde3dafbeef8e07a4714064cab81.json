King would allude to the album's title song in the 1990 revised and expanded edition of his novel The Stand, where a survivor of the novel's flu pandemic changes the lyrics to &quot;Who Made Flu.&quot; Three tracks on the album ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ &quot;Who Made Who&quot; and\nthe instrumentals &quot;D.T.&quot; and &quot;Chase the Ace&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ were newly written and recorded by AC/DC. The rest were taken from the band's previous albums. Only one song, &quot;Ride On,&quot; is from the Bon Scott era; the others all feature Brian Johnson. The album has sold 5 million copies in the USA. The album reached #11 in the UK and #33 in the US. Along with the album, the band released a video tape which contained music videos for the songs &quot;Who Made Who&quot;, &quot;You Shook Me All Night Long&quot;, &quot;Shake Your Foundations&quot;, &quot;Hells Bells&quot;, and footage from a live performance of &quot;For Those About to Rock (We Salute You)&quot; which was filmed in\nDetroit in 1983. The album was re-released in 2003 as part of the AC/DC Remasters series.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e7521b53b5c7fde3dafbeef8e07a4714064cab81","amp;dn":"ACDC+-+Who+Made+Who+%281986%29+%5BLOSSLESS+FLAC%5D%5BTntvillage.Scambioeti","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e7521b53b5c7fde3dafbeef8e07a4714064cab81","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,82,27,83,181,199,253,227,218,251,238,248,224,122,71,20,6,76,171,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
