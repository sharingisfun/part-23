Basically he was &quot;studying up&quot; on song placement and solos tobe expected. Having worked at both the Superdome and in Cleveland, N.W. had friends atother venues. He simply asked a friend working the show in Cleveland to get him a copy of the show and fire it off to us in Seattle. The guy brought in his home deck, walked up to the board, and being on the crew they plugged him in. Just that simple. These reels are a direct copy of the master cassettes done in the early 80â€™s on a brand new Akai GX-77 reel deck using Maxell XLII tape at 7.5 ips and the rare EE equalization that the tape required. I personally have a better trust in this source than I do in the actual masters now. The masters still exist, but they arenâ€™t going in the mail, and after so many years, I just think that 7.5 ips quarter inch reels are the best way to go. They may never have been played before Weedwackerâ€™s efforts. I kept a second â€œplayâ€ copy on Maxell UD reels for listening. This source is pristine, not one of the bootleg versions, not off crude cassette copies from me in the 80â€™s. This is the real deal. Thank you Weedwacker for stepping \r\nup to make this happen, you and Darrell, and NW, and whoever the guy was that plugged in.  \r\n\r\nComments: \r\nThis show gets criticized a lot, but it is really a good show, with lots of energy and intensity. The playing is great and the versions of Kashmir, Achilles Last Stand, and Ten Years Gone are exceptional, as is No Quarter. A really enthusiastic crowd feeds off of Zeppelin's energy, making for a memorable show. Plant sometimes complaining of monitor problems, especially during the acoustic set","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d54b2b416aa45f9e62c8ef92573ff304c7e3da83","amp;dn":"Led+Zeppelin+-+1977.04.27+Cleveland%2C+Ohio+MP3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d54b2b416aa45f9e62c8ef92573ff304c7e3da83","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,75,43,65,106,164,95,158,98,200,239,146,87,63,243,4,199,227,218,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
