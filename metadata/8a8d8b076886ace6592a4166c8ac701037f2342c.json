First, Krabs hears of a mythical tree with dollar bills for leaves. To what ends will he go to possess this fiscal foliage? You, SpongeBob, and Squidward all find out in 'The Money Tree' by Graham Annable. For this issue's pin-up, former Air Pirates artist Gary Hallgren paints a giant Bikini Bottom dollar bill with Krabs himself in the presidential spot. Also, in 'Squidmund Visits,' Squidward's got company, so he must get his house's feng shui in order. But Squidward forgot to plan for one thing - or make that two things: one yellow, one pink! All this plus facts about sand dollars, Patrick's introduction to the 3-second rule, and an adorable back cover by Graham Annable!\n\n\n\nMy Blog: &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/user/bpfine/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/user/bpfine/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8a8d8b076886ace6592a4166c8ac701037f2342c","amp;dn":"SpongeBob+Comics+Issue+24+%28PDF%29+-+Sept+2013","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8a8d8b076886ace6592a4166c8ac701037f2342c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,141,139,7,104,134,172,230,89,42,65,102,200,172,112,16,55,242,52,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
