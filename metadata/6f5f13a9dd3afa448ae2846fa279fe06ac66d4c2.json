Sirens of the Ditch is his solo debut. A resident of Muscle Shoals, Alabama, Isbell clearly has Catholic taste in his roots rock. His backing band throws together a pleasant mÃƒÂ©lange of pedal steel, organ, strummed acoustic guitar, and heartfelt Americana vocals. At first, it sounds like something you've heard before a thousand times, by Ryan Adams or was that Bryan Adams. However, on closer inspection, there's a lot more going on. After rhyming &quot;bitch&quot; with &quot;ditch&quot; in the song &quot;Ditch,&quot; Isbell throws in a line about &quot;dancing to 'Purple Rain'&quot; and you're drawn in, to a clearly delineated but poetic storyline and gorgeous melodies. Isbell's best songs will remind you of Richard Buckner, Raymond Carver, and Neil Young. &quot;Dress Blues&quot; might be the most sympathetic and awesome song about the Iraq war yet written. Huzzah. --Mike McGonigal","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f5f13a9dd3afa448ae2846fa279fe06ac66d4c2","amp;dn":"Jason+Isbell+-+Sirens+Of+The+Ditch+%5B2007%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f5f13a9dd3afa448ae2846fa279fe06ac66d4c2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,95,19,169,221,58,250,68,138,226,132,111,162,121,254,6,172,102,212,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
