However, one thing is for certain, it's is not in the bank to which we entrusted it. The bank and our money is already a part of the cycle of the global money market. \n\n\nLetÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Make Money is an anti-capitalist Austrian documentary by Erwin Wagenhofer released in 2008. It is about aspects of the development of the world wide financial system, focussing on how elitists economically exploit the rest of society, especially in the developing world, but also in western nations.\n\n\n\nThe film starts by tracking the hypothetical savings of a typical depositor as they move around the global system, often causing exploitation as various financial agents try to produce high returns. There are several interviews with investment managers, politicians, economists as well as homeless people and workers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDirected &amp; Written by: Erwin Wagenhofer\n=======================================\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle................:    Lets Make Money\nYear.................:    2008\nGenre................:    Documentary \nVideo Length.........:    01:47:39\n\n\nAudio Bitrate........:    128 kbit/s\nAudio Codec..........:    (AC3) \nLanguage.............:    English        \nDisplay Aspect ratio.:    16/9\n\nVideo Codec..........:    XviD \nVideo Resolution.....:    608x408\nVIdeo Bitrate........:    1010 kbit/s\n\n\nSubs.................:    External English [ONLY ON FOREIGN LANGUAGES] \nFile Size:...........:    700 MB\nFPS..................:    29.970000\n\nChannel(s)...........:    2 channels\nRelease date.........:    2008\n\n\n\n\n\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1307963/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1307963/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: External subtitles included: [ONLY ON FOREIGN LANGUAGES] \n==============================================================\n\n  \n\n\n\nYOUR CHOICE\n\nWTC-SWE\n\n\n\n\n(Please seed so others can enjoy)\n\n\n\n\nFor further information and pictures/images of all my torrents visit\\&quot; Suprbay Forum\\&quot; at \nthis link: &lt;a href=&quot; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&lt;/a&gt;                 \n\n*** This information is also avaible on the \\&quot;nfo\\&quot; file that comes with all my uploads.)***   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                           *** RECOMMENDED DOWNLOAD ***\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac66c8c7cc0b3a6ec7c49a6c98d2695d9ee24f77","amp;dn":"Lets+Make+Money-%28WTC-SWE%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac66c8c7cc0b3a6ec7c49a6c98d2695d9ee24f77","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,102,200,199,204,11,58,110,199,196,154,108,152,210,105,93,158,226,79,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
