The video follows a Bonnie and Clyde-esque plot with Iglesias and Hewitt running from their enemies in the desert. Finally, Iglesias&amp;#039; enemies track him down and confront him outside a church. The video skips ahead where we see Iglesias and Hewitt in the rain surrounded by police cars. Iglesias clutches his torso, implying that he&amp;#039;d been shot. The video ends with Iglesias&amp;#039; death. However, it is assumed that the police caught Rourke.\n\n\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:658f6b34225c5d6db1c3d761c507c9723c31c0da","amp;dn":"Enrique+Iglesias+-+Heroe+%28Latin+Version%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"658f6b34225c5d6db1c3d761c507c9723c31c0da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,143,107,52,34,92,93,109,177,195,215,97,197,7,201,114,60,49,192,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
