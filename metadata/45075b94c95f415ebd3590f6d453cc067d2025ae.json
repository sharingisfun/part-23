Well I got impatient and ripped these MP3's from a web stream and they sound pretty good - at least good enough to tide us all over until a CD rip is available.  Due to these MP3's being stream rips the intro (a 00:32 long track entitled &quot;Crucifucking the Possessed&quot;) wasnt available and therefore not in this torrent.  Please enjoy this decent rip of a great album until a better quality becomes available.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFormed in 1994, Christ Inversion was a short lived black/death metal project formed by Anton Crowley (AKA Philip Anselmo). Most of their lyrics were based on horror films and Satanism. The band recorded two demos and then disbanded without ever recording a full length album. The first demo was re-released in 2004 by Funeral in Hell Records, the second demo was re-released on Anselmo's own Housecore Records on October 28,2008. The band describes their sound as &quot;The venomous vomit of Satan!&quot; and cites their influences as Venom, Celtic Frost and SATAN HIMSELF.\n\nMEMBER LINEUP:\nWayne Fabra (vocals) \nPhil Anselmo (guitar) (Pantera, Down, Superjoint Ritual) \nKevin Bond (guitar) (Superjoint Ritual, Artimus Pyledriver) \nJay Gracianette (bass) \nRoss Karpelmann (keyboard) \nTommy Buckley (drums) (Soilent Green, Crowbar)\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAll MP3's are 128 kbps.\n\n1.
