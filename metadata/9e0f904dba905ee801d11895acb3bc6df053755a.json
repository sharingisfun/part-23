Spencer \r\nFormat: PDF \r\nHardcover: 384 pages \r\nPublisher: Wiley; 4 edition (January 26, 2016) \r\nLanguage: English \r\nISBN: 9781119061953 \r\n\r\n\r\nMaintaining a standard of excellence that establishes The Probabilistic Method as the leading reference on probabilistic methods in combinatorics, the Fourth Edition continues to feature a clear writing style, illustrative examples, and illuminating exercises. The new edition includes numerous updates to reflect the most recent developments and advances in discrete mathematics and the connections to other areas in mathematics, theoretical computer science, and statistical physics.\r\n\r\nEmphasizing the methodology and techniques that enable problem-solving, The Probabilistic Method, Fourth Edition begins with a description of tools applied to probabilistic arguments, including basic techniques that use expectation and variance as well as the more advanced applications of martingales and correlation inequalities. The authors explore where probabilistic techniques have been applied successfully and also examine topical coverage such as discrepancy and random graphs, circuit complexity, computational geometry, and derandomization of randomized algorithms. Written by two well-known authorities in the field, the Fourth Edition features:\r\n\r\n- Additional exercises throughout with hints and solutions to select problems in an appendix to help readers obtain a deeper understanding of the best methods and techniques\r\n- New coverage on topics such as the Local Lemma, Six Standard Deviations result in Discrepancy Theory, Property B, and graph limits\r\n- Updated sections to reflect major developments on the newest topics, discussions of the hypergraph container method, and many new references and improved results\r\n\r\nThe Probabilistic Method, Fourth Edition is an ideal textbook for upper-undergraduate and graduate-level students majoring in mathematics, computer science, operations research, and statistics. The Fourth Edition is also an excellent reference for researchers and combinatorists who use probabilistic methods, discrete mathematics, and number theory","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e0f904dba905ee801d11895acb3bc6df053755a","amp;dn":"The+Probabilistic+Method%2C+4th+Edition+%5B2016%5D+%5BPDF%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e0f904dba905ee801d11895acb3bc6df053755a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,15,144,77,186,144,94,232,1,209,24,149,172,179,188,109,240,83,117,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
