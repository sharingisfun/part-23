Hearkening back to a somewhat simpler, more basic British Invasion approach as psychedelia began to explode in the late '60s, the group also reached the Top Five with their flower-power ballad &quot;Love Is All Around&quot; in 1968. While more popular in their native England than the U.S., the band also fashioned memorable, insistently riffing hit singles like &quot;With a Girl Like You,&quot; &quot;Night of the Long Grass,&quot; and the notoriously salacious &quot;I Can't Control Myself&quot; between 1966 and 1968. Paced by Reg Presley's lusting vocals, the group -- which composed most of their own material -- could crunch with the best of them, but were also capable of quite a bit more range and melodic invention than they've been given credit for.\n\nRead all of the bio at: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-troggs-p5701/biography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-troggs-p5701/biography&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Review (by Richie Unterberger):\n\nA double-CD, 52-track box set that proves there was a lot more to The Troggs than &quot;Wild Thing&quot; and &quot;Love Is All Around.&quot; This archetypally primitive British Invasion quartet scored many hits in the U.K. that barely dented the charts in the U.S., like &quot;With A Girl Like You,&quot; &quot;Night Of The Long Grass,&quot; and the notoriously racy &quot;I Can't Control Myself.&quot; They're all here, along with notable album cuts, B-sides, and worldwide post-1968 flops. Primitive they may have been, but The Troggs -- who wrote most of their own material -- did not lack a flair for hard pop hooks, and could display a surprising delicacy in their ballads. Several of their obscure singles and album tracks are equal in worth to their hits, like the gothic but pretty &quot;Cousin Jane,&quot; and the witty light psychedelia of &quot;Maybe the Madman&quot; and &quot;Purple Shades.&quot; Some of the '70s hard rockers and glammish novelties are unimpressive, and 52 songs is arguably excessive. But there are a fair number of obscure gems to be found on this well-annotated package.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/album/archeology-1967-1977-r77304&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/album/archeology-1967-1977-r77304&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAmazon.com's page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000001DWM&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000001DWM&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\nDisc 1:\n\n01.
