Burnside spent most of his life in the rural hill country of northern Mississippi, \n\nworking as a sharecropper and a commercial fisherman, as well as playing guitar at weekend house parties. \n\nHe was first inspired to pick up the guitar in his early twenties, after hearing the 1948 John Lee Hooker single, \n\n&quot;Boogie Chillen&quot; (which inspired numerous other rural bluesmen, among them Buddy Guy, \n\nto start playing). He learned music largely from Mississippi Fred McDowell, \n\nwho lived nearby in an adjoining county. He also cited his cousin-in-law, Muddy Waters, as an influence.\n\nDuring the 1950s, Burnside grew tired of sharecropping and moved to Chicago, \n\nIllinois in the hopes of finding better economic opportunities. \n\nBut things did not turn out as he had hoped. Within the span of one month his father, brother, \n\nand uncle were all murdered in the city, a tragedy that Burnside would later draw upon in his work, \n\nparticularly in his interpretation of Skip James's &quot;Hard Time Killing Floor&quot; and the talking blues &quot;R.L.'s Story,&quot; \n\n]the opening and closing tracks on Burnside's 2000 album, Wish I Was In Heaven Sitting Down.\n\nAround 1959, he left Chicago and went back to Mississippi to work the farms and raise a family.
