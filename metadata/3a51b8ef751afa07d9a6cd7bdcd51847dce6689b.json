One morning, a young lady awakens to find that she has lost all her memories prior to that morning. Her life, her relationships, her very nameÃ¢â‚¬â€all gone. All that's left is a cell phone with numbers and names she doesn't recognize and Orion, a young boy that only she appears to be able to see. With Orion's guidance, she struggles to make sense of herself, a boyfriend she doesn't know and the thousand and one little things that make up a daily life. But with no memories left, the only alternative is to forge new ones, even if that means leaving old loves behind.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a51b8ef751afa07d9a6cd7bdcd51847dce6689b","amp;dn":"Amnesia+-+Complete","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a51b8ef751afa07d9a6cd7bdcd51847dce6689b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,81,184,239,117,26,250,7,217,166,205,123,220,213,24,71,220,230,104,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
