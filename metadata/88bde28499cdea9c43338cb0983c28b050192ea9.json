I don't believe I'll be doing it as long as I did back in 2011, where I was able to put up 964 Christian Albums.  Instead, I think I'd rather spend some of 2012 taking requests to torrent specific albums.  But then again, time will tell.\n\nYet, as always, if you're downloading any of these torrents today, please find it within you to continue sharing back perhaps a little longer than you otherwise might.  I don't have the hard drive or bandwidth resources to continue to support these torrents once they're fully seeded.  God Bless!\n\nToday's 2nd bundle includes the following 24 releases...\n\n * Anneline Breetzke - 2012 - Grace Revolution\n * Blank Pages - 2012 - S-T\n * Brilliance, The - 2012 - Cavetime\n * Color Me Valiant - 2012 - Secrets EP\n * DJ Heartbeat Dancer - 2012 - JC Is The Key\n * Dueling Pianos - 2012 - White Water Chopped Sticks\n * Feel Good Drag, The - 2012 - The Feel Good Drag EP\n * Forgiven - 2012 - Desperate\n * Fray, The - 2012 - Scars And Stories\n * Fred Hammond - 2012 - God Love And Romance\n * Hillsong United - 2012 - Passion\n * James Fortune And FIYA - 2012 - Identity\n * Jordan Love - 2012 - Uncomplicated\n * Kari Jobe - 2012 - Where I Find You\n * KB - 2012 - Zone Out - Single\n * Lightswitch - 2012 - Holding On\n * Remnant - 2012 - Something Real\n * Spark, The - 2012 - Shinen Brightly\n * Starfield - 2012 - The Kingdom\n * Terry Green - 2012 - A New Place\n * Various - 2012 - Sample Of Life 2\n * Walking With Kings - 2012 - Walking With Kings\n * We Shot The Moon - 2012 - We Are All Odd EP\n * Worship Central - 2012 - Spirit Break Out\n\n\nDetails of both bundles can be found further below...\n\nTorrentTracts, February 2012\n\n\n\n--BUNDLE 02 of 02------------------------------------------------------\n\n * Anneline Breetzke - 2012 - Grace Revolution\n * Blank Pages - 2012 - S-T\n * Brilliance, The - 2012 - Cavetime\n * Color Me Valiant - 2012 - Secrets EP\n * DJ Heartbeat Dancer - 2012 - JC Is The Key\n * Dueling Pianos - 2012 - White Water Chopped Sticks\n * Feel Good Drag, The - 2012 - The Feel Good Drag EP\n * Forgiven - 2012 - Desperate\n * Fray, The - 2012 - Scars And Stories\n * Fred Hammond - 2012 - God Love And Romance\n * Hillsong United - 2012 - Passion\n * James Fortune And FIYA - 2012 - Identity\n * Jordan Love - 2012 - Uncomplicated\n * Kari Jobe - 2012 - Where I Find You\n * KB - 2012 - Zone Out - Single\n * Lightswitch - 2012 - Holding On\n * Remnant - 2012 - Something Real\n * Spark, The - 2012 - Shinen Brightly\n * Starfield - 2012 - The Kingdom\n * Terry Green - 2012 - A New Place\n * Various - 2012 - Sample Of Life 2\n * Walking With Kings - 2012 - Walking With Kings\n * We Shot The Moon - 2012 - We Are All Odd EP\n * Worship Central - 2012 - Spirit Break Out\n\n\n--BUNDLE 01 of 02------------------------------------------------------\n\n * Andre Van Zyl - 2012 - Found In You\n * Anthem Lights - 2012 - The Acoustic Sessions\n * Bethel Music - 2012 - The Loft Sessions\n * Blessed By A Broken Heart - 2012 - Feel The Power\n * Celtic Woman - 2012 - Believe\n * Chris August - 2012 - No Far Away - Deluxe Edition\n * Christen Cole - 2012 - To The World\n * Convalesce - 2012 - Consequences EP\n * Corey Paul - 2012 - 730am Vol 3 - No Sick Days\n * David Crowder Band - 2012 - Give Us Rest\n * Eric Potter - 2012 - Breathe On Us\n * Jadon Lavik - 2012 - I Have Decided To Follow Jesus - Single\n * Lindsay McCaul - 2012 - If It Leads Me Back - Deluxe Edition\n * Lunie 3-80 - 2012 - Rosary Rap\n * Manafest - 2012 - Never Let You Go - Single\n * Mark And Sarah - 2012 - Kingdom Of God\n * Phil Joel - 2012 - Playlist\n * Rachel Chan - 2012 - Go\n * Rend Collective Experiment - 2012 - Homemade Worship By Handmade People\n * Steve Clark - 2012 - Save The Day\n * Theory Hazit - 2012 - Thr3e\n * Various - 2012 - Rappers 4 Christ\n * Vineyard - 2012 - I Love Your Presence\n * Vocal Few - 2012 - She'll Be Right EP\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:88bde28499cdea9c43338cb0983c28b050192ea9","amp;dn":"2012+-+The+Year+In+Christian+Music+%28Bundle+02+of+02%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"88bde28499cdea9c43338cb0983c28b050192ea9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,189,226,132,153,205,234,156,67,51,140,176,152,60,40,176,80,25,46,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
