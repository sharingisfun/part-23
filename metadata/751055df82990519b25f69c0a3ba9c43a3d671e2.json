He is a scientist who spends much of his time in his basement laboratory but when he's not there, he seems to take great pleasure in demeaning his niece. She can't wait for him to die and doesn't hesitate to tell him so. When he dies from an accidental fall down the stairs, she is free. She does inherit his wealth but can only keep it if she stays in the house. She also has to care for the thing he created in his lab - a life-sized robot into which Simon Polk has programmed his own personality.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:751055df82990519b25f69c0a3ba9c43a3d671e2","amp;dn":"The+Twilight+Zone+-+Uncle+Simon","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"751055df82990519b25f69c0a3ba9c43a3d671e2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,16,85,223,130,153,5,25,178,95,105,192,163,186,156,67,163,214,113,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
