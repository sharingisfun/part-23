The guys set out to do a major update to the house to increase the space's functionality while preserving the home's character and history. They swap the entryways, turning an underused foyer into a bold library and dining area; tackle an outdated kitchen and give the living room a serious facelift. While in the Big Easy, the guys experience all the city has to offer; taking their first taste of an oyster and alligator, and jumping in with a brass band parading through the streets of New Orleans!\n\n\n\n\nOriginal Air Date: 27-Dec-2014","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a29447b2b8a402b894f38c1eb8791f8ac5db56de","amp;dn":"Amish.RENOgades.S01E06.WS.DSR.x264-NY2.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a29447b2b8a402b894f38c1eb8791f8ac5db56de","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,148,71,178,184,164,2,184,148,243,140,30,184,121,31,138,197,219,86,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
