In 1962, Trower formed a group that became The Paramounts, later\nincluding Westcliff High School pupil Gary Brooker. The Paramounts disbanded in 1966 to\npursue individual projects. During this time, Trower created a local three-piece band called\nthe Jam [not to be confused with the later group with Paul Weller]. Trower then joined\nBrooker's new band Procol Harum following the success of their debut single &quot;A Whiter Shade\nof Pale&quot; in 1967, remaining with them until 1971 and appearing on Procol Harum's first five\nalbums.\n\nDisc: 1\n\n01 - Somebody Calling [2012 Remastered Version]\n02 - Sweet Wine Of Love [2012 Remastered Version]\n03 - Bluebird [2012 Remastered Version]\n04 - Falling Star [2012 Remastered Version]\n05 - Farther On Up The Road [2012 Remastered Version]\n06 - Smile [2012 Remastered Version]\n07 - Little Girl [2012 Remastered Version]\n08 - Love's Gonna Bring You Round [2012 Remastered Version]\n09 - In City Dreams [2012 Remastered Version]\n\nDisc: 2\n\n1 - My Love [Burning Love] [2012 Remastered Version]\n2 - Caravan To Midnight [2012 Remastered Version]\n3 - I'm Out To Get You [2012 Remastered Version]\n4 - Lost In Love [2012 Remastered Version]\n5 - Fool [2012 Remastered Version]\n6 - It's For You [2012 Remastered Version]\n7 - Birthday Boy [2012 Remastered Version]\n8 - King Of The Dance [2012 Remastered Version]\n9 - Sail On [2012 Remastered Version]\n\nDisc: 3\n\n01 - Jack And Jill [2012 Remastered Version]\n02 - Roads To Freedom [2012 Remastered Version]\n03 - Victims Of The Fury [2012 Remastered Version]\n04 - The Ring [2012 Remastered Version]\n05 - Only Time [2012 Remastered Version]\n06 - Into The Flame [2012 Remastered Version]\n07 - The Shout [2012 Remastered Version]\n08 - Mad House [2012 Remastered Version]\n09 - Ready For The Taking [2012 Remastered Version]\n10 - Fly Low [2012 Remastered Version]\n\nDisc: 4\n\n01 - Into Money [Feat - Jack Bruce] [2012 Remastered Version]\n02 - What It Is [Feat - Jack Bruce] [2012 Remastered Version]\n03 - Won't Let You Down [Feat - Jack Bruce] [2012 Remastered Version]\n04 - No Island Lost [Feat - Jack Bruce] [2012 Remastered Version]\n05 - It's Too Late [Feat - Jack Bruce] [2012 Remastered Version]\n06 - Life On Earth [Feat - Jack Bruce] [2012 Remastered Version]\n07 - Once The Bird Has Flown [Feat - Jack Bruce] [2012 Remastered Version]\n08 - Carmen [Feat - Jack Bruce] [2012 Remastered Version]\n09 - Feel The Heat [Feat - Jack Bruce] [2012 Remastered Version]\n10 - End Game [Feat - Jack Bruce] [2012 Remastered Version]\n\nDisc: 5\n\n01 - Gonna Shut You Down [Feat - Jack Bruce] [2012 Remastered Version]\n02 - Gone Too Far [Feat - Jack Bruce] [2012 Remastered Version]\n03 - Thin Ice [Feat - Jack Bruce] [2012 Remastered Version]\n04 - Last Train To The Stars [Feat - Jack Bruce] [2012 Remastered Version]\n05 - Take Good Care Of Yourself [Feat - Jack Bruce] [2012 Remastered Version]\n06 - Fall In Love [Feat - Jack Bruce] [2012 Remastered Version]\n07 - Fat Gut [Feat - Jack Bruce] [2012 Remastered Version]\n08 - Shadows Touching [Feat - Jack Bruce] [2012 Remastered Version]\n09 - Little Boy Lost [Feat - Jack Bruce] [2012 Remastered Version]\n\n\nCodec................: LAME 3.99\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Insane, [avg - bitrate: 320kbps]\nChannels.............: Full Stereo...Same as CD / 44100 hz\nTags.................: ID3 v1.0, ID3 v2.3\nInformation..........: Enjoy.. - AND SEED ON !\n\nRipped and Encoded By: oneanight\n\nPLEASE SEED - PLEASE SHARE - PLEASE UPLOAD","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9aa050c1a9bb58a58bf47ccad00606d720810099","amp;dn":"Robin+Trower+-+%5B2015%5D+Original+Album+Series+%5BMP3+%40+320%5D+%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9aa050c1a9bb58a58bf47ccad00606d720810099","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,160,80,193,169,187,88,165,139,244,124,202,208,6,6,215,32,129,0,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
