True beauty is wild-girl Mandarin Ramey: 17, shameless and utterly carefree. Grace would give anything to be like Mandarin. \n\nWhen they're united for a project, they form an unlikely, explosive friendship, packed with nights spent skinny-dipping in the canal, liberating the town's animal-head trophies, and searching for someplace magic. Grace plays along when Mandarin suggests they run away together. Blame it on the crazy-making wildwinds plaguing their Badlands town. \n\nBecause all too soon, Grace discovers Mandarin's unique beauty hides a girl who's troubled, broken, and even dangerous. And no matter how hard Grace fights to keep the magic, no friendship can withstand betrayal.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3fbe554d6b71b967e209b0c588345e010260454b","amp;dn":"Kirsten+Hubbard+-+Like+Mandarin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3fbe554d6b71b967e209b0c588345e010260454b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,190,85,77,107,113,185,103,226,9,176,197,136,52,94,1,2,96,69,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
