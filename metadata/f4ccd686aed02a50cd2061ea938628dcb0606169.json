Tinker\n\n&quot;With incisiveness and honesty, the work of four\nproselytizing missionaries and their drive to convert\nAmerican Indians to Christianity are convincing!)Ã‚Â«\nlinked with Euroamerican political and militaty\nstrategy. The result: a continuing genocide, unmatched\nin historical literature, a brutal fantasy confounded\nby contradictions. With unmistakable indignation\nand a keen awareness of contemporary politics,\nTinker reminds us that these myths have held sway for\nso long that we - Indians and non-Indians - must\nnow open our eyes and refuse to participate in the\nmarginalization and threats to American Indians and\niheir diverse ways of life.&quot;\n- lnes M.
