After Julia dies in front of J's eyes from a self-inflicted heroin overdose, J, who is slightly detached from life, feels he has no choice but to contact his maternal grandmother, Janine &quot;Smurf&quot; Cody, the family matriarch, for a place to live. Smurf rules the family with a borderline incestuous love over her three sons, the quietly menacing Andrew &quot;Pope&quot; Cody, the hyperactive Craig Cody, and the barely of age Darren Cody. Pope and his best friend, Barry &quot;Baz&quot; Brown, are armed robbers, with Darren their up and coming apprentice, while Craig is a mid level drug dealer. Melbourne's Armed Robbery Squad is after specifically Pope, who is hiding out. But when the standoff between the Codys and the Armed Robbery Squad is brought up a notch.\n\n\n\nGeneral Information\n\nFormat : AVI at 988 Kbps\nLength : 800 MiB for 1h 53mn 10s 325ms\nVideo : MPEG-4 Visual at 867 Kbps\nAspect : 640 x 272 (2.353) at 23.976 fps\nAudio : MPEG Audio at 112 Kbps\nInfos : 2 channels, 44.1 KHz\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:64ddb8b6e63c300432d26547bf51b424144f6a65","amp;dn":"Animal.Kingdom.2010.DvDrip.Xvid-EMPIrE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"64ddb8b6e63c300432d26547bf51b424144f6a65","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,221,184,182,230,60,48,4,50,210,101,71,191,81,180,36,20,79,106,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
