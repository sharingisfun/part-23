The film explores how Cynthia developed her unique pursuit, follows the ups and downs of casting sessions with a shy guitarist and an extroverted glam rocker, and goes along for the ride as Ms. Caster prepares for her first gallery show in New York City. Featuring candid interviews with &quot;castees,&quot; candidates, and commentators Noel Redding (The Jimi Hendrix Experience), Jello Biafra (The Dead Kennedys), Eric Burdon (The Animals), Pete Shelley (The Buzzcocks), Jon Langford (Mekkons), Wayne Kramer (MC-5), Paul Barker (Ministry), as well as author Camille Paglia and artist Ed Paschke Plaster Caster goes beyond the mythology and asks the question, &quot;is it really art?&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c9aa5aa2931ac929035d55c1ebf9cd863420a6ea","amp;dn":"Plaster+Caster+%282001%29+avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c9aa5aa2931ac929035d55c1ebf9cd863420a6ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,170,90,162,147,26,201,41,3,93,85,193,235,249,205,134,52,32,166,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
