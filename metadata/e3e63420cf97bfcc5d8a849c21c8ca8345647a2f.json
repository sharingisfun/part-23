The Road Was Lonely\n\nBridget Saint John's first album was a wholly acoustic, almost wholly solo folk affair, though different from many British folk albums of the time in that it was comprised entirely of self-composed material. Saint John sang low-key, reflective, slightly sad songs that were unsurpassed, really, in their extraordinary level of containment. That's not say they were brilliant, or even as good as those of another British singer/songwriter of the time known for reserved meditations, Nick Drake. There was, however, the sense of an unflappable woman whose temperature would remain unchanged by nothing short of an equatorial sun. Her deep voice makes her sound at times rather like a Nico who can sing more in tune, without Nico's gothic or more bizarre streaks. Perhaps there's a tinge of FranÃƒÂ§oise Hardy without the pop sensibility, too, if you're looking for another comparison. It's music for wandering through meadows on overcast days, though a sameness to the presentation (the slide guitar on &quot;Many Happy Returns&quot; makes for a welcome dash of urgency) and a lack of excellent melodies can make it easy for one's mind to wander.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3e63420cf97bfcc5d8a849c21c8ca8345647a2f","amp;dn":"Bridget+St.+John+-+Ask+Me+No+Questions+%281969%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e3e63420cf97bfcc5d8a849c21c8ca8345647a2f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,230,52,32,207,151,191,204,93,138,132,156,33,200,202,131,69,100,122,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
