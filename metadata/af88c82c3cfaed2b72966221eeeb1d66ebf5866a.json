It's full of books, pencils, science projects and...other stuff. &quot;Too much stuff,&quot; says her teacher, Ms. Basil. On a family visit to her Uncle Aldo's one night, Miranda wonders if some of his magician's tools might offer a solution to her messy-desk problem. Sneaking off to the magic room, Miranda finds Uncle Aldo's impressive collection of top hats. Miranda knows that magic top hats can hold lots of things--why not the mess from her desk? At first, the hat seems to do the trick, but soon things start to go horribly wrong. As Uncle Aldo says, &quot;you have to be careful with magic.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af88c82c3cfaed2b72966221eeeb1d66ebf5866a","amp;dn":"Messy+Miranda+by+Jeff+Szpirglas+%26amp%3B+Danielle+Saint-Onge+%28retai","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af88c82c3cfaed2b72966221eeeb1d66ebf5866a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,136,200,44,60,250,237,43,114,150,98,33,238,235,29,102,235,245,134,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
