An unlikely friendship blossoms between two 10 year-old boys from different backgrounds during the racially charged backdrop of rural Texas, 1964. Through the years into manhood, prevailing attitudes and the growing civil rights movement severely test their friendship. In the end, they will discover that despite people's differences, it's the memories you make that determine your happiness and peace in life. \n\nRuntime: 87 mins\nLanguage: English\nYear: 2010\nQuality: 10/10 \nFormat: avi format \n\nSee reviews here,  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon(dot)com/Christmas-In-Canaan/dp/B00AJBFQJK&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon(dot)com/Christmas-In-Canaan/dp/B00AJBFQJK&lt;/a&gt;\n\n&quot;Don't ask me what Christ can do for you!
