The ability to sense a person's most intimate secrets, or predict the stock market, or move virtually unseen. For thirty years the world has struggled with a growing divide between the exceptional...and the rest of us.\n\nNow a terrorist network led by brilliants has crippled three cities. Supermarket shelves stand empty. 911 calls go unanswered. Fanatics are burning people alive.\n\nNick Cooper has always fought to make the world better for his children. As both a brilliant and an advisor to the president of the United States, he's against everything the terrorists represent. But as America slides toward a devastating civil war, Cooper is forced to play a game he dares not lose - because his opponents have their own vision of a better world.\n\nAnd to reach it, they're willing to burn this one down.\n\nFrom Marcus Sakey, &quot;the master of the mindful page turner&quot; (Gillian Flynn) and &quot;one of our best storytellers&quot; (Michael Connelly), Book Two of the Brilliance Saga is a relentless thrill ride that will change the way you look at your world - and the people around you","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb71640c03aca5865f776738e967e732232e5448","amp;dn":"Marcus+Sakey+-+A+Better+World+%28Brilliance+Saga+%232%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb71640c03aca5865f776738e967e732232e5448","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,113,100,12,3,172,165,134,95,119,103,56,233,103,231,50,35,46,84,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
