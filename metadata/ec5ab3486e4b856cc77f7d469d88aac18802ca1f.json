Reading space updatesÃ¢â‚¬â€and seeing pictures of Neil Armstrong on the lunar surface in National GeographicÃ¢â‚¬â€was the ignition of this dream.\n\nAt nineteen he sold his first company and employed the remnants of the Russian Space Program, three of the best space brains in the world. In his twenties he founded and sold two more companies and hired the most outstanding scientists and engineers from the European Space Authority. During his thirties, after selling his third company, he invested heavily in Internet start-ups, like Google, netting billions. Then he patiently waited until NASAÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s shuttle program came to an end and contracted the best brains in the U.S. Space program.\n\nNow, Ryan Richmond is in his fifties, has angered, fought with, and shot at many of the WorldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most powerful countries from Space, and is not welcome in the Northern Hemisphere.\n\nRyan doesn't really care, as he is millions of miles away, enjoying himself flying around the solar system, and about to return to Planet Earth.\nGenre: Sci-Fi","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec5ab3486e4b856cc77f7d469d88aac18802ca1f","amp;dn":"AMERICA+ONE+-+Return+To+Earth+%28Book+4%29+-+T.+I.+Wade.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec5ab3486e4b856cc77f7d469d88aac18802ca1f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,90,179,72,110,75,133,108,199,127,125,70,157,136,170,193,136,2,202,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
