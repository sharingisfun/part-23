Included will be a variety of sweaters and vests and a few accessories, like hats, mittens, scarves and slippers.\n\nIt will include classic masculine styles (Nordic, cables, ribs, stripes) made modern through color and yarn selection. The designs will be contemporary - sweaters and accessories that men will want to wear. The yarns will be classics-smooths and chunky yarns-for the most part in natural fibers like wool and cotton. The colors will be masculine-some grays, browns, blues, etc.-but reflect current designer trends.\n\nThe projects will be suitable for a variety of skill levels, with most appropriate for the advanced beginner and intermediate knitter. Unusual techniques will be taught, but this is not a &quot;to knit&quot; book.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c39835ad15a95cd0884eb0d7f7760f6c89d145bf","amp;dn":"Knits+for+Men%3A+20+Sweaters%2C+Vests+and+Accessories","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c39835ad15a95cd0884eb0d7f7760f6c89d145bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,152,53,173,21,169,92,208,136,78,176,215,247,118,15,108,137,209,69,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
