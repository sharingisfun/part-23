Take opener ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Bending the Rules of TimeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ which immediately transports us with whistles, strings and those soon-to-be-familiar choral vocals. A kind of work song for the dead, it is a brief and wonderfully melodic songdream. In fact none of these pieces outstay their welcome, allowing us to feel as though we just happened to grasp them for a moment: music at once spontaneous and eternal.\n\nIn a break from the acoustics, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“TrustÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ employs stuttering feedback worthy of Washing Machine-era Sonic Youth before collapsing into hazy music box melancholy. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“CrowsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ allows the mood to darken further with a repeated entreaty for the subject to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œwake upÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. It sounds like a wake outside the caravan and beneath the stars. It is left to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Seconds In MotionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ to close the record with a gentle reverie of harmonica and slide guitar. Another, until now hidden, continent creeps into view for a moment and we sense possibilities beyond these gentle haunted lawns. But thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s for another time, insofar as Savaging Spires pay attention to such constraints. For now we have one of the most evocative records youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re likely to hear this year.\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/about/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87a401543baf106deedc9d7cffe678aad2cdae36","amp;dn":"Savaging+Spires...Savaging+Spires%282011%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87a401543baf106deedc9d7cffe678aad2cdae36","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,164,1,84,59,175,16,109,238,220,157,124,255,230,120,170,210,205,174,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
