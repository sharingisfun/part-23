Either all the millions of inhabitants are dead, or they have been transformed into energy beings beyond human perception. Earthâ€™s population was reduced by ninety percent. Human civilization on Earth is now recovering from this trauma and even has a vigorous space program.\r\n\r\nApollo Papadopulos is in training to become the captain of the starship Consensus. Apollo is a unique individual in that he/she/it is not an individual at all, but five separate teenagers who form a new entity. Strom, Meda, Quant, Manuel, and Moira are a pod, as these kinds of personalities are called, genetically engineered to work as one and to be able to communicate non-verbally. As a rare quintet, much relies on the successful training of Apollo, but as more accidents occur, the pod members struggle just to survive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFormat: MP3\r\nBitrate: 32 Kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bae57c6762769fe5c45d87b72e8f4c3e6ce77834","amp;dn":"Paul+Melko+-+Singularity%27s+Ring","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bae57c6762769fe5c45d87b72e8f4c3e6ce77834","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,229,124,103,98,118,159,229,196,93,135,183,46,143,76,62,108,231,120,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
