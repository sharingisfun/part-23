You do not need\n to re-install and  re-configure the operating system.\n\n Forgotten password recovery software has a simple user interface,\n supports  multiple hard disk drives, detects several SAM databases\n (if multiple OS were  installed on one volume) and provides the opportunity\n to pick the right SAM  before starting the password recovery process.\n It displays a list of all local users. The software user simply chooses\n the local user from the list to reset  the password.\n\n Other Windows login security restrictions like 'Account is disabled', \n 'Password never expires', 'Account is locked out', 'User Must Change\n Password at  Next Logon' and 'Logon Hours' can be changed or reset.\n\n With Active@ Password Changer you can log in as a particular user\n with a  blank password.\n\n  Features:\n\n    * New!
