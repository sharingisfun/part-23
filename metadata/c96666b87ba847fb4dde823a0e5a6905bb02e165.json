The US Army was not prepared for combat in France, and the remarkable achievement of the AEFÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s commanding officer, John J Pershing, was the creation of an American field army, built and nurtured from the bottom up. This book details the organizational structure, training and doctrine of the AEF and illustrates how it came to make a significant contribution to Allied victory in World War I","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c96666b87ba847fb4dde823a0e5a6905bb02e165","amp;dn":"The+American+Expeditionary+Forces+in+World+War+I","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c96666b87ba847fb4dde823a0e5a6905bb02e165","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,102,102,184,123,168,71,251,77,222,130,58,14,90,105,5,187,2,225,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
