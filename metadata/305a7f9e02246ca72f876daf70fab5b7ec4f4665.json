The WCE 2009 is organized by the International Association of Engineers (IAENG), with congress details available at: http://www.iaeng.org/WCE2009. IAENG is a non-profit international association for the engineers and the computer scientists, which was found originally in 1968. There have been more than eight hundred manuscript submissions for the WCE 2009.\n\nElectronic Engineering and Computing Technology contains sixty-one revised and extended research articles written by prominent researchers participating in the conference.
