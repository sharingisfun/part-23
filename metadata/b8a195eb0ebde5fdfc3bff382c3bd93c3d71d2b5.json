Formed in 2005, the group was formerly signed to Mediaskare Records and released two full-length studio albums. The band broke up in 2012, but reformed in 2014.\nWhile writing their follow up album, Blind Witness signed to heavy music label Mediaskare Records and entered the studio to record Nightmare on Providence Street. Released in 2010, the album was met with positive reviews, with Absolute Punk scoring it 84 percent and the reviewer stating that &quot;metal core is one of the most hated genre's of metal. I believe that Blind Witness can prove that wrong to a lot of different metal fans. \nBlind Witness was founded in 2005, by vocalist Jonathan Cabana in Granby, Quebec along with friends guitarist Pier-Luc Desroches and drummer Kevin Desroches. They later added guitarist/vocalist Maxime Lacroix and bassist Miguel Lepage to the roster. In 2005, the band began performing in Montreal. \nWe are really excited to share this new music with you 6 years after our last release! As promised when the band broke up, we are finally releasing a 5 song EP, entirely self-produced and we could not be more proud of the result! \n \nGenre: Metalcore/Deathcore\n \nCurrent members:\nJonathan Cabana Ã¢â‚¬â€œ lead vocals (2005Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2012, 2014-present)\nMaxime Lacroix Ã¢â‚¬â€œ lead guitar, backing vocals (2005Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2011, 2014-present), studio songwriting (2010-2012)\nEric Morotti Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums (2009Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2012, 2014-present)\nOlivier Roy Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitars (2011Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2012, 2014-present)\nFrancis &quot;Frank the Tank&quot; Beaupre Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bass (2011Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2012, 2014-present)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b8a195eb0ebde5fdfc3bff382c3bd93c3d71d2b5","amp;dn":"Blind+Witness+-+I+Am+Hell+%28EP%29+%282015%29+%28VBRVO%29+%5BMentalZero%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b8a195eb0ebde5fdfc3bff382c3bd93c3d71d2b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,161,149,235,14,189,229,253,252,59,255,56,44,59,217,60,61,113,210,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
