Both bands are comprised of members Ryan Ogren (vocals, guitar), Peter Munters (vocals, guitar), Jon Berry (vocals, bass), Nick Bailey (vocals, guitar), and James Ulrich (drums). In its Runner Runner configuration, the group released an EP in 2008 with the help of producer Tommy Henriksen. In February of 2011, the band made their full-length debut for Capitol Records with the self-titled Runner Runner.\n\nReleased: 2010\nGenre: Rock\nStyle: Pop, Alternative \nQuality: Lossless\nCodec: MP3\nBit rate: VBR\nSource: Converted from FLAC\n\n Tracks:\n\n  1.
