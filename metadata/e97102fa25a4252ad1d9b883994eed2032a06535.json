The murky and disembodied sounds that float through these compositions give the impression of light refracting to the depths of a calm and peaceful ocean floor. Songs like &quot;Drowsy Haze&quot; are true to their titles in mood as well as lyrical content: &quot;Drowsy haze of those summer days was deep in my lungs,&quot; Hirway sings on the breezy bedroom dream pop number. The Pacific Northwest coast, rusting memories, trips to the lake, glimmering city skylines, and the nostalgia of car trips are all themes that populate this earthy electronic record. Occasionally, Hirway works with stuttering beats -- as on &quot;Shivers,&quot; for example. But in a curious fashion, Hirway is actually much more of a singer/songwriter than other likeminded bedroom electro-acoustic gurus like Four Tet or Manitoba, and he is at his strongest when he keeps the beats spare and organic, even simple.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e97102fa25a4252ad1d9b883994eed2032a06535","amp;dn":"he+One+AM+Radio+-+A+Name+Writ+In+Water+%282004%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e97102fa25a4252ad1d9b883994eed2032a06535","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,113,2,250,37,164,37,42,209,217,184,131,153,78,237,32,50,160,101,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
