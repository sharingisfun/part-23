They continue up to the American abandonment of Saigon, followed by a single photo of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, along with a photo of a single (black) disabled veteran. Many of the usual photos, such as the self-immolation of the Buddhist monk in Saigon, the elegant ladies of Vietnam, the crumpled faces of the Americans directing this mess and the many faces of the American soldies and Vietnamese victims of the war machines. A lot of combat, but not as much as one might expect; not a book for an idiot enthusiast of war's mayhem. More color than one might expect. Photos from America as well, demonstrations etc. A picture of America's favorite pretty boy (JF Kennedy, who sanctified it all) and the Toad, Daly of Chicago. Too bad the cops of that city didn't get what the people of Vietnam got; there's a color picture of those swine beating Americans in this book","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6993c1fc4cf8195f5945bd377709f1bfdd7624e","amp;dn":"Images+of+War+%28Time+Life+-+Vietnam+Experience%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6993c1fc4cf8195f5945bd377709f1bfdd7624e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,153,60,31,196,207,129,149,245,148,91,211,119,112,159,27,253,215,98,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
