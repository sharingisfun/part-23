He confronts his father, Sheamus, the following morning for causing the suffering of Mary. He spends the rest of the day at his school - his parents being at work. Fergus is approached by another student, Piper, with whom he has a short discussion. Sheamus shows up with Mr. Tully - the teacher who has let Fergus onto the grounds - to take him to the doctor for a regular check up. Almost immediately, a police officer arrives to arrest Fergus for drug possession.
