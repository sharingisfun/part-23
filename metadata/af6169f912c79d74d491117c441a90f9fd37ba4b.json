He mailed tapes of his music to friends and musicians he admired; one of his tapes made its way to Frank Black, who was impressed enough with Polonsky's work that he produced a demo tape for him and helped him find a manager. Once again, Polonsky sent out tapes -- this time to record companies -- and secured a deal with American Records in 1995. The following year his first album, Hi My Name Is Jonny, was released. However, soon after the album's release, American lost its distribution deal and Polonsky was left without a label until he found eggBERT several years later; in 2001 he released the There Is Something Wrong with You EP, his first new material in five years. The Power of Sound followed in 2004. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHi My Name is Jonny 1996\n\n\nTracks: \n\nLove Lovely Love\nTruly Ugly And Dead Too\nIn My Mind\nEvil Scurvy Love\nGone Away\nDown low\nHalf Mind\nIt's Good To Sleep\nI Don't Know What To Dream At Night\nUh-Oh\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af6169f912c79d74d491117c441a90f9fd37ba4b","amp;dn":"Jonny+Polonsky+-+Hi+My+Name+is+Jonny+1996+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af6169f912c79d74d491117c441a90f9fd37ba4b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,97,105,249,18,199,157,116,212,145,17,124,68,26,144,249,253,55,186,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
