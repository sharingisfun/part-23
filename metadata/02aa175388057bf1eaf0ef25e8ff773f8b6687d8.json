Six of its eight songs were written by Angus Young, Malcolm Young and Bon Scott. &quot;Soul Stripper&quot; was written by the Young brothers and &quot;Baby, Please Don't Go&quot; is a cover version of a Big Joe Williams song. \n\nThe album was produced by Vanda &amp; Young at Albert Studios in Sydney, Australia. George Young is the older brother of Angus and Malcolm, who also played bass guitar on a number of the album's songs, and played bass guitar at some of AC/DC's live shows. Harry Vanda was a bandmate of George's in The Easybeats. George and Harry were the main songwriters of The Easybeats' later hits, including their international hit &quot;Friday on My Mind&quot;.\n\nHigh Voltage was originally released on Albert Productions only in Australia, and has never been reissued by another label in this format. The international version of High Voltage, that was issued on Atlantic Records in 1976, has a different cover art and track listing, with only &quot;She's Got Balls&quot; and &quot;Little Lover&quot; appearing overseas. &quot;Baby Please Don't Go&quot;, &quot;Soul Stripper&quot;, &quot;You Ain't Got a Hold On Me&quot; and &quot;Show Business&quot; were later released on '74 Jailbreak in 1984. &quot;Stick Around&quot; and &quot;Love Song&quot; have been released on Backtracks in 2009.\n\nMP3 - 320kbs\n  \n    \n    &quot;Baby, Please Don't Go&quot;      Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:50\n    &quot;She's Got Balls&quot;            Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:51\n    &quot;Little Lover&quot;               Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:39\n    &quot;Stick Around&quot;               Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:44\n    &quot;Soul Stripper&quot;              Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 6:25\n    &quot;You Ain't Got a Hold on Me&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:31\n    &quot;Love Song&quot;                  Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:14\n    &quot;Show Business&quot;              Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:46\n\n\n\nPlease Dont Hit And Run !\n\nAnd Please Feel free to Comment, Reguest and tell me what you like :D","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:02aa175388057bf1eaf0ef25e8ff773f8b6687d8","amp;dn":"AcDc+-+1975+-+High+Voltage+%28Australia+Only%29+%5B320kbs%5D+%7E%7ERenovatio","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"02aa175388057bf1eaf0ef25e8ff773f8b6687d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,170,23,83,136,5,123,241,234,240,239,37,232,255,119,63,139,102,135,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
