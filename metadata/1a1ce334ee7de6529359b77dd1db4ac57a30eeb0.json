Pitney is sometimes characterized (or dismissed) as a shallow teen idol-type prone to operatic ballads. It's true that some of his biggest hits -- &quot;Town Without Pity,&quot; &quot;Only Love Can Break a Heart,&quot; &quot;I'm Gonna Be Strong,&quot; &quot;It Hurts to Be in Love,&quot; and &quot;Twenty Four Hours From Tulsa&quot; -- are archetypes of adolescent or just-post-adolescent agony, characterized by longing and not a little self-pity.\n\nRead all of the bio at: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/artist/gene-pitney-p5148/biography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/artist/gene-pitney-p5148/biography&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Reviews:\n\n2 for 1\nAMG Review by Stephen Thomas Erlewine\n\nSequel reissued the bulk of Gene Pitney's '60s albums for Musicor as a series of compact discs that contains two original albums each. Although the material on each disc is different, one basic pattern does emerge -- by and large, the singles were the best songs on each album, but the remaining songs, usually comprised of solid album tracks, covers and filler, are generally interesting to hardcore fans, since Pitney has such a uniquely dramatic voice. In other words, most fans will be satisfied by one of the many hits collections, but these discs are essential for serious fans and collectors.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/album/im-gonna-be-strong-looking-through-the-eyes-of-love-r258662&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/album/im-gonna-be-strong-looking-through-the-eyes-of-love-r258662&lt;/a&gt;\n\n==========\n\nI'm Gonna Be Strong\nAMG Review by Donald A. Guarisco\n\nThis typically ambitious 1964 outing found Gene Pitney blending rock drama and pop smoothness with great success. I'm Gonna Be Strong is an especially worthwhile entry in the Pitney canon because it includes several great performances. Good examples include the title track, a typically intense Pitney heartbreak ballad that builds from quiet anguish to a dramatic declaration of self-reliance over a lush yet punchy instrumental backing, and &quot;It Hurts to Be in Love,&quot; a tune that finds Pitney layering a dynamic, double-tracked vocal over a song that cleverly contrasts heartbroken lyrics with a bouncy, hook-laden keyboard pop melody. Other memorable tracks on I'm Gonna Be Strong include &quot;Lips Were Redder on You,&quot; a lovelorn track penned by oddball pop auteur Joe Meek that is driven by a percolating keyboard hook, and &quot;That Girl Belongs to Yesterday,&quot; an operatic pop ballad full of low brass and descending piano runs that was penned by Keith Richards and Mick Jagger. ...\n\nSee all at: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/album/im-gonna-be-strong-r46754/review&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/album/im-gonna-be-strong-r46754/review&lt;/a&gt;\n\n==========\n\nLooking Through the Eyes of Love\nAMG Review by Donald A. Guarisco\n\nAs other pop artists began to pursue new styles of pop in the wake of the Beatles and the Byrds, Gene Pitney continued to blend pre-rock romantic sentiment and orchestral pop/rock grandeur on 1965's Looking Through the Eyes of Love. It produced a pair of notable pop chart hits with the title track and &quot;I Must Be Seeing Things&quot;: the former is a tale of redemption through love that Pitney wrings for every last drop of operatic drama he can muster while the latter is a tale of romantic betrayal that uses an elegant orchestral backing to highlight Pitney's pained vocal delivery. Looking Thru the Eyes of Love also included a British Top Ten hit in &quot;Just One Smile,&quot; an early Randy Newman tune that allowed Pitney to explore the extent of his dramatic range with its tale of the giddy highs and painful lows of a love affair. \n\nSee all at: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/looking-through-the-eyes-of-love-r15301/review&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/looking-through-the-eyes-of-love-r15301/review&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nAmazon.com's page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000000PTU&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000000PTU&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
