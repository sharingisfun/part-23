Because the attack was judged completely illegal, the Soviet Union was expelled from the League of Nations on December 14. Soviet leader Josef Stalin had expected to conquer the whole country by the end of 1939, but Finnish resistance frustrated the Soviet forces, who outnumbered the Finns 4:1 in men, 100:1 in tanks and 30:1 in aircraft[3]. Finland held out until March 1940, when a peace treaty was signed ceding about 10% of Finland\\&amp;#039;s territory and 20% of its industrial capacity to the Soviet Union.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b5dd5ceff0d1e909cb0232d5c0c2c19e93419777","amp;dn":"Battlefield-Scandinavia-Forgotten.front.Winter-War.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b5dd5ceff0d1e909cb0232d5c0c2c19e93419777","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,221,92,239,240,209,233,9,203,2,50,213,192,194,193,158,147,65,151,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
