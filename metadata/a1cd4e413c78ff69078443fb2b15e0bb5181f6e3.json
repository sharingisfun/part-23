The album was recorded over a year in New York and London. the album includes the single &quot;Only The Horses&quot;, which was co-produced with Calvin Harris. \n\nTypical Amazon Customer review\nMagic hour is a terrific return to form for the awesome foursome, with sweeping ballads and catchy dance numbers, and even the odd House style track thrown in for good measure, Magic Hour will certainly remain among my top albums for a good while to come. My only minor foible is that the SS leaked and previewed a good half of the tracks before releasing the album and so as a result, the album lacks the surprises that it would normally. However this isn't a musical complaint, and if this is the first time you're about to hear &quot;Shady Love&quot; or &quot;kiki&quot; then you are in for a real real treat! \n\ncd ripped by X Lossless Decoder version 20120407 (140.0)\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i809.photobucket.com/albums/zz12/elitter/fd0138fdb1-1.gif&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i809.photobucket.com/albums/zz12/elitter/fd0138fdb1-1.gif&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/about/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/about/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a1cd4e413c78ff69078443fb2b15e0bb5181f6e3","amp;dn":"Scissor+Sisters...Magic+Hour%282012%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a1cd4e413c78ff69078443fb2b15e0bb5181f6e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,205,78,65,60,120,255,105,7,132,67,251,43,21,224,187,81,129,246,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
