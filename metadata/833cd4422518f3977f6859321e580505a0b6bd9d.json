But by the time their first night in the state had ended, three volunteers were dead, black churches had burned, and America had a new definition of freedom.\nThis remarkable chapter in American history, the basis for the controversial film Mississippi Burning, is now the subject of Bruce Watson's thoughtful and riveting historical narrative. Using in- depth interviews with participants and residents, Watson brilliantly captures the tottering legacy of Jim Crow in Mississippi and the chaos that brought such national figures as Martin Luther King Jr. and Pete Seeger to the state. Freedom Summer presents finely rendered portraits of the courageous black citizens-and Northern volunteers-who refused to be intimidated in their struggle for justice, and the white Mississippians who would kill to protect a dying way of life. Few books have provided such an intimate look at race relations during the deadliest days of the Civil Rights movement, and Freedom Summer will appeal to readers of Taylor Branch and Doug Blackmon.\n\nThe New York Times - Dwight Garner\nMr. Watson's book derives its powerÃ¢â‚¬â€at its best, it is the literary equivalent of a hot light bulb dangling from a low ceilingÃ¢â‚¬â€from its narrow focus. Freedom Summer is about the more than 700 college students who, in the summer of 1964, under the supervision of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, risked their lives to travel to Mississippi to register black voters and open schoolsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦The story of these months has been told before, but rarely this viscerally.\n\nPublishers Weekly\nIn this mesmerizing history, Watson (Sacco and Vanzetti) revisits the blistering summer of 1964 when about 700 volunteers arrived in Mississippi to agitate for civil rights and endured horrific harassment, intimidation, and persecution from racist state and private forces. The largely white, college student volunteers and the largely black trainers and organizers, SNCC veterans of previous campaigns, were fed and sheltered by the impoverished black community members they had come to serve and secure suffrage for. Their path was two-pronged: the Freedom SchoolÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s challenge to a Ã¢â‚¬Å“power structure... that confined Negro education to 'learning to stay in your placeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and the Mississippi Freedom Democratic PartyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s challenge to MississippiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all-white delegation to the 1964 Democratic National Convention. Familiar figures (e.g., Lyndon B. Johnson, Stokely Carmichael, Fannie Lou Hamer) take the stage, but WatsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dramatic center belongs to four Ã¢â‚¬Å“ordinaryÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ volunteers, whose experiences he portrays with resonant detail. The murdered Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner cast shadows over all, haunting WatsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s account of how the volunteers, organizers, and the black Mississippians who dared seek political expression Ã¢â‚¬Å“lifted and revived the trampled dream of democracy.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (June)\n\n\nBruce Watson is an award-winning journalist whose articles have been published in Smithsonian, Los Angeles Times, Boston Globe, San Francisco Examiner, Yankee Magazine, and The Best American Science and Nature Writing 2003.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:833cd4422518f3977f6859321e580505a0b6bd9d","amp;dn":"Bruce+Watson+-+Freedom+Summer+%5B96%5D+Unabridged","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"833cd4422518f3977f6859321e580505a0b6bd9d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,60,212,66,37,24,243,151,127,104,89,50,30,88,5,5,160,182,189,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
