ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a doggie delight! \n\nThese dogs beg to be patted, tickled, scratched, and ruffled. Which one will be your best friend? Zakanitch created the paintings for this book as an extension of his Aggressive Goodness Series of large-scale dog portraits whose unabashed purpose was to evoke the notion of goodness and to remind people of their aptitude for compassion. He lives in New York.\n\nGenre: Children | Picture Book / Poetry","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b8a9c5c1439eb9307b40d9934de48e8cc0cb3e69","amp;dn":"Good+Dog+by+Maya+Gottfried+%2F+Robert+Rahway+Zakanitch","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b8a9c5c1439eb9307b40d9934de48e8cc0cb3e69","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,169,197,193,67,158,185,48,123,64,217,147,77,228,142,140,192,203,62,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
