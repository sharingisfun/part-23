For the best quality in VLC with HD material:\npreferences/show--settings:all/video/filters/disable all filters, especially post-processing filter.\n\n***in MPC-HC options be sure to select atleast Enhanced Video Renderer or Video Mixing renderer 9. \n--in options/playback/output/DirectShow Video\n\nFLiCKSiCK releases have the goal to keep a good balance between video and audio quality at the smallest file size possible. There are already other teams delivering such deal,but to me they stress too much the filesize at the cost of quality, especially audio quality, so there we go.
