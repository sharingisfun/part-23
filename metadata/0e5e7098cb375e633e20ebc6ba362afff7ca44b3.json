The village had the       \n distinction of housing the largest mental    \n asylum in the region and in the mÃƒÂªlÃƒÂ©e that   \n ensued during partition, the asylum inmates  \n broke loose, drove away the villagers and    \n established their own republic in Paglapur.  \n And that's how it stayed for the next 60     \n years! While the world outside changed,      \n Paglapur remained isolated, with no          \n electricity, television or sanity. Now,      \n decades after the world forgot this village, \n a NASA scientist of Indian origin, Agastya   \n and his beautiful wife find themselves on    \n                                              \n                                              \n  IMDB Link :                                 \n                                              \n    &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1918886/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1918886/&lt;/a&gt;     \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img856.imageshack.us/img856/7175/720pjokerddr.gif&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img856.imageshack.us/img856/7175/720pjokerddr.gif&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img99.imageshack.us/img99/5908/14815666.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img99.imageshack.us/img99/5908/14815666.png&lt;/a&gt;\n                                                   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img18.imageshack.us/img18/4512/48376668.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img18.imageshack.us/img18/4512/48376668.png&lt;/a&gt;\n                                                   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img41.imageshack.us/img41/6792/41182381.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img41.imageshack.us/img41/6792/41182381.png&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e5e7098cb375e633e20ebc6ba362afff7ca44b3","amp;dn":"Joker+%282012%29+720p+DVDRip+x264+AC3+%5BDDR%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e5e7098cb375e633e20ebc6ba362afff7ca44b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,94,112,152,203,55,94,99,62,32,235,198,186,54,42,255,247,202,68,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
