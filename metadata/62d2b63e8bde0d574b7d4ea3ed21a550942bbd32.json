Finally, the topic of financial modelling using VBA is treated.\n\nAimed at intermediate and advanced level modellers in Excel who wish to extend and consolidate their knowledge, this book is focused, practical, and application-driven, facilitating knowledge to build or audit a much wider range of financial models.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nReviews:\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&quot;A well structured reference. If you are unclear how best to approach a modelling task or you are ready to reconsider some of your modelling habits, this is a useful bag of tricks and thoughts which can greatly simplify your task.&quot;\n--Dominik Geller; Head of Corporate Risk Management; F. Hoffmann -La Roche AG\n\n&quot;Michael Rees has written a financial modelling book that is exceptional in its clarity, balance of theory and practice, and its abundance of invaluable examples. Comprehensive and application-driven in its topical coverage, it is one of the very few books that address the modelling process itself. Michael Rees enables even the desperate readers to design, structure and build models appropriate for their situation and provides them with a sound and practical foundation to bring financial modelling to life.&quot;\n--Johannes Klose, Principal, Allianz Risk Transfer\n\n&quot;Michael Rees has hit the nail on the head. In Financial Modelling in Practice, he has addressed many common problems business professionals face in accurately representing their real-life situations as Excel spreadsheets. Modelling is crucial for informed decision-making, as is taking uncertainty and risk into account. Michael Rees addresses these needs in a practical, easily understood way that is both robust and accessible.&quot;\n--Randy Heffernan, Vice President, Palisade Corporation\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAbout the Author:\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMichael Rees gained a BA with First Class Honours and a Doctorate in Mathematics from Oxford University in 1985 and 1988 respectively.
