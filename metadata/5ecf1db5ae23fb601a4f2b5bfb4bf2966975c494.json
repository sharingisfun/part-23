Its state-of-the-art cinematography creates an intimate sense of place and captures a world of wonder, transporting viewers to isolated, undisturbed corners of the globe so pure they remind us of how the ancient world once was.\n\n\nMadagascar - A World Apart\nThree hundred miles off the east coast of Africa lies an island forgotten by time. A place where evolution has taken the familiar and created the bizarre. Separated from the mainland for over a hundred million years, life here has followed its own Darwinian path. Home to a host of creatures found nowhere else - this is an alternate world where lush rainforests fall to sun-scorched plains and trees seem to stand with their roots in the sky. Preserved by its isolation, this wondrous realm is a land unlike any other.\n\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\nVideo Codec: X264\nVideo Bitrate: 2050 KB/s\nAverage Quants:\n* I:16.50 to 17.50\n* P:17.50 to 18.50\n* B:19.00 to 20.00\nVideo Resolution 1 - 14: 640 x 464 (4:3)\nVideo Resolution 15 - 24: 688 x 368 (16:9)\nAudio Codec: AAC\nAudio BitRate: 128 KB/s\nAudio Channels: 2 Ch\nRunTime: 00:47\nFramerate: 25 FPS\nNumber Of Parts: 24\nPart Size: 744 MB\nEncoded by: gavin63\nSubtitles: No TV Cap\nSource: DVB\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1) Related Documentaries \n* Planet Earth\n* Greatest Places\n* The Living Planet\n\n\n\nSource: http://docuwiki.net/index.php?title=The_Living_Edens","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ecf1db5ae23fb601a4f2b5bfb4bf2966975c494","amp;dn":"National+Geographic+The+Living+Edens+08of24+Madagascar+DVB+x264+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ecf1db5ae23fb601a4f2b5bfb4bf2966975c494","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,207,29,181,174,35,251,96,26,79,43,91,251,75,242,150,105,117,196,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
