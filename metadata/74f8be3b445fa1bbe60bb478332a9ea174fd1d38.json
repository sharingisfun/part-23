A good album without a doubt but the next one is an improvement in pretty much every area.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:74f8be3b445fa1bbe60bb478332a9ea174fd1d38","amp;dn":"Circus+%28Switzerland%29+-+Circus+%281976%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"74f8be3b445fa1bbe60bb478332a9ea174fd1d38","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,248,190,59,68,95,161,187,230,11,180,120,51,42,158,161,116,253,29,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
