For the uninitiated, Gigi is a wonderful Ethiopian singer whoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s made a name for herself (in America, that is ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ in France sheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s better known) collaborating with bassist/composer Bill Laswell on various projects ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ she has a nimble, melodious voice (a wee bit similar to Sheila ChandraÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s, though duskier, deeper, more soulful in the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAmericanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ sense) that doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t overdo the melisma (where a singer ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œworriesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ or extends words, often heard in Arabic and North African music).

The hypnotic rhythms percolate, providing a mesmerizing context for GigiÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s vocal flights and some tantalizingly brief but seductive instrumental solos. LaswellÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s here, too, but donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t expect the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œusualÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ sleek, pulsing/throbbing ambiance from him ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ the producing is spare and streamlined, &amp; he forsakes the bass this time ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“round for keyboards and acoustic guitar. There are undertones of jazz, gospel and reggae, but subtly ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ the Ethiopian trad sound is paramount, though itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not coming out of a purist vacuum. Zion Roots is possessed of a rhythm-charged serenity and an unexaggerated, heartfelt sensuality, and clearly and opinionatedly one of the finest ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œworld musicÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ releases (African division) of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢03.\nReviewed by: Mark Keresman\nMONTHLY JAZZ NEWSLETTER:\n\n\n\nRobin Denselow The Guardian, Friday 10 October 2003\n\nThe Ethiopian singer Ejigayehu &quot;Gigi&quot; Shibabaw recorded a best-selling Africa-funk-jazz crossover set, simply titled Gigi, in which she was joined by a celebrity cast that included the likes of Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock and David Gilmore.\n\nNow she's back with another excellent, more African-influenced album, on which she sings lead vocals, has written all the songs that aren't traditional, and acts both as co-producer and arranger. And yet, mysteriously, this is not being promoted as a Gigi album. It's titled Zion Roots, which makes it sound like a mediocre reggae set, and it's credited to Abyssinia Infinite &quot;featuring Gigi&quot;.\n\nThe result is far more interesting than the packaging would suggest. The musicians are mostly Ethiopian, and are joined by the album's co-producer Bill Laswell, playing keyboards and acoustic guitar.\n\nGigi's clear, soulful vocals are backed by a subtle blend of insistent percussion, traditional Ethiopian flute and harp, along with saxophone and chugging accordion, while Laswell's wash of keyboard effects is for the most part a discreet addition. From the gentle Gela to the more jazz and gospel-influenced Lebaye (both of which she wrote) this is Gigi's album and she deserves the credit.\n\n***** \nGuardian 2003","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed65a25e3e90329ef6915e574cc0a6ff751f141b","amp;dn":"Abyssinia+Infinite+Zion+Roots","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed65a25e3e90329ef6915e574cc0a6ff751f141b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,101,162,94,62,144,50,158,246,145,94,87,76,192,166,255,117,31,20,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
