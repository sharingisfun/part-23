Moving in radical circles, she agitated for social change in the prewar years, and she epitomized the independent New Woman of the time. Her death at age 30 while stumping for suffrage in California in 1916 made her the sole martyr of the American suffrage movement. Her death helped inspire two years of militant protests by the National WomanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Party, including the picketing of the White House, which led in 1920 to ratification of the 19th Amendment granting women the right to vote. LumsdenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s study of this colorful and influential figure restores to history an important link between the homebound women of the 19th century and the iconoclastic feminists of the 1970s.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5eca94fd67ca2792cec2831300710711399db29e","amp;dn":"Inez+Milholland+-+Suffragist+Martyr+-+Linda+Lumsden","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5eca94fd67ca2792cec2831300710711399db29e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,202,148,253,103,202,39,146,206,194,131,19,0,113,7,17,57,157,178,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
