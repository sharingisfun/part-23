Check out:\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot; http://blog.wolfram.com/2007/07/mathematica_601_arrives.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://blog.wolfram.com/2007/07/mathematica_601_arrives.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n   for more information...\n\n   &quot;It&amp;#039;s now two months since we released Mathematica 6, and I am happy to\n   say that all our years of development and testing seem to be paying off:\n   Mathematica 6 is a robust system that is performing excellently.\n\n   Looking at our internal development database, I see that 6.0.1 contains\n   259 individual code improvements relative to 6.0.0 (as well as a great\n   many documentation and tutorial updates).\n\n   What are they all? Well, they are distributed throughout the system (as\n   well as in an update to the free Mathematica Player) - reflecting the\n   continuing work of our many software development teams.\n\n   There are a few areas that we pushed hard to include in 6.0.1 on the\n   basis of feedback about 6.0.0. A leading example is the enhancement\n   of automatic and manual proxy settings for internet connectivity.\n\n   Connecting directly to the internet is a new capability for Mathematica,\n   and feedback indicated that we needed to make it easier for people to\n   handle complex internet connectivity setups. So, we have done this in\n   6.0.1.\n\n   Another area is legacy documentation. In Mathematica 6 we upgraded many\n   pieces of functionality from &quot;standard packages&quot; to built-in kernel\n   functions. The old standard package functions are still available for\n   compatibility - and now in 6.0.1 their documentation is fully searchable.\n\n   There are some good infrastructure improvements, too. After additional\n   testing time, we&amp;#039;re now satisfied that we can release a change to the\n   low-level interprocess communication protocol we use - which improves\n   MathLink throughput by a factor of nearly 50 on Mac and Unix systems.\n\n   We&amp;#039;ve also made changes to our asynchronous process startup mechanism to\n   streamline the initialization of services such as the Mathematica in-\n   product help system.\n\n   Speaking of the help system, we&amp;#039;ve been adding many new function\n   examples and many tutorials, all of which are now available in 6.0.1.\n\n   We&amp;#039;ve also added many updates to our curated data for functions like\n   CountryData and FinancialData. Many of these appear automatically\n   whenever Mathematica connects to our servers, and all of them are\n   included in 6.0.1.\n\n   We are continually improving the core code of Mathematica, making it\n   more efficient, broader, and more robust. We made many such improvements\n   in 6.0.1 - for example, greatly increasing the performance of ListPlot,\n   ListPlot3D, and Plot3D for inputs involving a large number of data\n   points.\n\n   We&amp;#039;re quite obsessive about the overall software quality of Mathematica,\n   hunting down every last bug - sometimes for years. For 6.0.1, we squashed\n   a whole range of bugs. To give a sense of what they were, here are a few\n   random examples: On 64-bit Windows, the front end could crash if the\n   contents of a Tooltip were insanely large.\n\n   On Linux systems with Firefox set as the default browser, hyperlinks\n   containing &quot;&amp;&quot; would not work. And in some extreme cases on Intel\n   CPUs, RandomInteger with the non-default method MKL could return\n   values outside the prescribed bounds.\n\n   And, of course, everything you&amp;#039;ve created in Mathematica 6.0.0 will work\n   in Mathematica 6.0.1.\n\n   But a few new things will work too, and it&amp;#039;ll be a little (or in a few\n   cases, a lot) faster.&quot;\n\n   Long recognized as the world&amp;#039;s most powerful mathematical software system,\n   Mathematica has steadily grown in breadth and depth to become today an\n   unparalleled platform for all forms of computation.\n\n   Powering innovation in research, development, and education.\n\n   With thousands of original algorithms and a tightly unified overall design,\n   Mathematica spans projects of all sizes, from simple calculator operations\n   and educational demonstrations to large-scale systems deployment and\n   maximum-power supercomputing.\n\n   The most important advance in the 20 year history of Mathematica.\n\n   Building on two decades of world-class algorithm and software development,\n   Mathematica 6 represents a dramatic breakthrough that immensely broadens\n   Mathematicas scope and applicability, and redefines the very way we think\n   about computation.\n\n   Made possible by Mathematica&amp;#039;s unique symbolic architecture, Mathematica 6\n   introduces a sweeping unification of language and interface concepts that\n   makes possible a new level of automation in algorithmic computation,\n   interactive manipulation and dynamic presentation, as well as a whole new\n   way of interacting with the world of data.\n\n   Mathematica 6.0 fundamentally redefines Mathematica and introduces a major\n   new paradigm for computation.\n\n   Building on Mathematica&amp;#039;s time-tested core symbolic architecture, version\n   6.0 adds nearly a thousand new functions almost doubling the total number\n   of functions in the system, dramatically increasing both the breadth and\n   depth of Mathematica&amp;#039;s capabilities, as well as introducing hundreds of\n   major original algorithms, and perhaps a thousand new ideas, large and\n   small.\n\n&lt;------------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;\n\n  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS\n\n   1. Unrar, Burn or mount with Daemon Tools.\n\n   2. Install Mathematica 6.0.1\n\n   3. Use the keygen in the EDGE dir to license your copy.\n\n   4.
