Little Steven here. Welcome to a very special event for all of us here at Sirius XM. I had the great privilege of spending a couple of hours with Robbie Robertson and you're about to hear that conversation in it's entirety here in 4 one-hour segments as we celebrate the release of his new album, &quot;How To Become Clairvoyant&quot;. He doesn't do many interviews, they are extremely rare so this is very special, but this is extra special for us because for the first time we have the opportunity to broadcast a conversation with an artist that is just as important in both of our formats, the Underground Garage and Outlaw Country&quot;\n\n\nPlaylists:\n\nShow 1: Thanksgiving Day Ã¢â‚¬â€œ November 24, 2011\n\nSegment 1:\nLife Is A Carnival  (The Band)\nWho Do You Love (Ronnie Hawkins &amp; The Hawks)\nI Can Tell (John Hammond)\nHey Pocky Way (Meters)\nFear Of Falling (new Robbie Robertson)\n\nSegment 2:\nRag Mama Rag (Band)\nLong Tall Sally (Little Richard)\nTiny Montgomery (Bob Dylan)\nHell's Half Acre (Robbie Robertson)\n\nSegment 3:\nI'm A Man (Bo Diddley)\nBacon Fat (Levon &amp; the Hawks)\nJust Like Thumb's Blues (Bob Dylan &amp; the Band)\nHe Don't Live Here No More (new Robbie Robertson)\n\n\nShow 2: Black Friday Ã¢â‚¬â€œ November 25, 2011\n\nSegment 1:\nCan You Please Crawl Out Your Window (Bob Dylan &amp; the Hawks)\nI Wish You Would (John Hammond)\nHe Don't Love You (Levon &amp; the Hawks)\nShowdown At Big Sky (Robbie Robertson)\n\nSegment 2:\nMillion Dollar Bash (Bob Dylan &amp; the Band)\nDon't Do It (Band)\nHelpless (Neil Young with The Band)\nThe Right Mistake (new Robbie Robertson)\nLeopard Skin Pillbox Hat (Bob Dylan)\n\nSegment 3:\nBaby Let Me Follow You Down (Bob Dylan with The Band /Waltz)\nComing Home (John Hammond)\nSkinwalker (Robbie Robertson)\nOphelia (The Band /Waltz)\n\n\nShow 3: November 26, 2011\n\nSegment 1:\nChest Fever (The Band)\nObviously 5 Believers (Bob Dylan)\nMannish Boy (Muddy Waters with The Band /Waltz)\nFallen Angel (Robbie Robertson)\n\nSegment 2:\nCaravan (Van Morrison with The Band /Waltz)\nThe Shape I'm In (The Band)\nShe's Not Mine (new Robbie Robertson)\nBaby Please Don't Go (John Hammond)\n\nSegment 3:\nLook Out Cleveland (The Band)\nOne Too Many Mornings (Bob Dylan &amp; The Band)\nSweet Fire Of Love (Robbie Robertson)\nHang Up My Rock n' Roll Shoes (The Band)\n\n\nShow 4: November 27, 2011\n\nSegment 1:\nStage Fright (The Band)\nI Want You To Love Me (John Hammond)\nPledging My Time (Bob Dylan)\nThis Is Where I Get Off (new Robbie Robertson)\n\nSegment 2:\nStraight Down the Live (new Robbie Robertson)\nI Don't Believe You (Bob Dylan with The Band)\nFurther On Up the Road (Eric Clapton with The Band)\nThe Weight (The Band)\n\nSegment 3:\nThe Night They Drove Old Dixie Down (The Band)\nWhen The Night Was Young (new Robbie Robertson)\nSooner Of Later (One Of Us Must Know) (Bob Dylan)\nBroken Arrow (Robbie Robertson)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bfd011c1a1f9f502f706e9e0de7ba6a1a5cac9cf","amp;dn":"Little+Stevens+Underground+Garage+Robbie+Robertson+Week","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bfd011c1a1f9f502f706e9e0de7ba6a1a5cac9cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,208,17,193,161,249,245,2,247,6,233,224,222,123,166,161,165,202,201,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
