Everyone was watching as the race for the White House unfolded like something from the realm of fiction. The meteoric rise and historic triumph of Barack Obama.... The shocking fall of the House of Clinton - and the improbable resurrection of Hillary as Obama's partner and America's face to the world.... The mercurial performance of John McCain and the mesmerizing emergence of Sarah Palin.\n\nBut despite the wall-to-wall media coverage of this spellbinding drama, remarkably little of the real story behind the headlines has yet been told. In Game Change, John Heilemann and Mark Halperin, two of the country's leading political reporters, use their unrivaled access to pull back the curtain on the Obama, Clinton, McCain, and Palin campaigns. How did Obama convince himself that, despite the thinness of his rÃƒÂ©sumÃƒÂ©, he could somehow beat the odds to become the nation's first African-American president? How did the tumultuous relationship between the Clintons shape - and warp - Hillary's supposedly unstoppable bid? What was behind her husband's furious outbursts and devastating political miscalculations? Why did McCain make the novice governor of Alaska his running mate? And was Palin merely painfully out of her depth - or troubled in more serious ways?\n\nGame Change answers those questions and more, laying bare the secret history of the 2008 campaign. This is a reportorial tour de force that reads like a fast-paced novel.\n\nÃ‚Â©2010 John Heilemann and Mark Halperin; (P)2010 HarperAudio\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:74752aff1001170a35e2a0f4cd4c255162fedb1d","amp;dn":"Game+Change+-+Heilemann%2C+Halperin+%282010+Uanabridged%29+64+cbr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"74752aff1001170a35e2a0f4cd4c255162fedb1d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,117,42,255,16,1,23,10,53,226,160,244,205,76,37,81,98,254,219,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
