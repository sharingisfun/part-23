While providing breathtaking views of skydiving over the Florida Keys, the Mojave Desert and in the magnificent Fjords of Norway, this giant-screen experience explores the psychological and physiological forces behind risk-taking, and the physics involved in these activities. In doing so, it also shows us how risk-taking is part of everyday life. The storyline focuses on two risk-takers, Adrian Nicholas and Katarina Ollikainen. Nicholas, a veteran skydiver who has performed thousands of jumps, is the record holder for the longest unassisted human flight, a 4-minute 55-second flight at speeds of up to 200 kilometers/hour that took place in 1999. Adrenaline Rush even allows spectators to directly experience a base jump thanks to a camera strapped to one of the professional jumpers who took part in the film. You can live through a 1300-meter (4150 feet) jump from a legendary cliff in Norway, the Katthammaren Wall.\n- Written by Sky High Entertainment\n\nx264 encoded from DVD source\t\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ccf2380b0bbfe629b0860cd5adc3c4465d3aaa0d","amp;dn":"Adrenaline+Rush+-+The+Science+of+Risk+%282002%29+DVDRip+x264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ccf2380b0bbfe629b0860cd5adc3c4465d3aaa0d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,242,56,11,11,191,230,41,176,134,12,213,173,195,196,70,93,58,170,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
