Women and Blacks have few rights. Jack Bull's dad is killed by Union soldiers, so the young men join the Bushwhackers, irregulars loyal to the South. One is a Black man, Daniel Holt, beholden to the man who bought his freedom. They skirmish then spend long hours hiding. Sue Lee, a young widow, brings them food. She and Jack Bull become lovers, and when he's grievously wounded, Jake escorts her south to a safe farm. The Bushwhackers, led by men set on revenge, make a raid into Kansas. At 19, Jake is ill at ease with war. As his friends die one after another, he must decide where honor lies.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e88d6980ec7fdc3b3e40f8d9aef6451070e8bda6","amp;dn":"Ride+With+The+Devil+-+XVID+-+LordManXCaT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e88d6980ec7fdc3b3e40f8d9aef6451070e8bda6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,141,105,128,236,127,220,59,62,64,248,217,174,246,69,16,112,232,189,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
