It is a unique two person method of practicing.  Your rival connects with you through circling, winding and adherence to a set technique, combining moves of connecting, leaning, bending and holding which develops the co-ordination of the internal and external strengths of the body.  \n\nFor improving Taichi skill and learning to adapat to changing moves, practicing pushing hands is crucial.  If you don&amp;#039;t have adequate Taichi quan skill, your rival will feel your weakness during the pushing hands movements.  There are five kinds of pushing hands forms in Chen style Taichi:  Single hand pushing, double hand pushing, natural hand pushing, stroking hand pushing and florist hand pushing (picking flowers without rule).\n\nSpecific---\n\nThe title of this torrent is NOT a typo.  &quot;Taiji&quot; is what the cover says, so thats what I am using here, even if its a typo on their part.\n\nVideo begins with an introduction to the Chen family style of Taichi\n- In Chinese, w/Chinese Subtitles\n- Followed by English w/ English Subtitles\n\nAt approximately 8m47s, the actual lesson begins...\n-Lesson is in Chinese and English\n-As is typical for this type of video, the moves are shown, then shown again\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNotes on the files:\n-Nothing fancy:  VCD -&gt; IsoBuster -&gt; .mpg\n-video is 36m 30s long\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is from the same series as my previous Chen style upload, so the quality of video/audio/content is comparable.\n\nSo...
