Bradley received much praise for convincing portrayal of the main protagonists, her respectful handling of the pagan ways of Avalon and for telling a story in which there is neither black and white or good and evil, but several truths. Isaac Asimov called it &quot;the best retelling of the Arthurian Saga I have ever read&quot;, and Jean Auel noted &quot;I loved this book so much I went out and bought it for a friend, and have told many people about it.&quot;[2] The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction calls the book &quot;a convincing revision of the Arthurian cycle,&quot; and said that the victory of Christianity over the &quot;sane but dying paganism&quot; of Avalon &quot;ensures eons of repression for women and the vital principles they espouse.&quot; It won the 1984 Locus Award for Best Fantasy Novel and spent four months on the New York Times best seller list in hardcover. The trade paperback edition of Mists of Avalon has ranked among the top five trade paperbacks on the monthly Locus bestseller lists for almost four years.[3]\n\nThe book has been criticised in some Christian circles for being nothing more than thinly-veiled feminist propaganda, as the stereotypically strong female lead of Morgaine is placed next to weak women like Gwenhwyfar and tortured male leads in the characters of a hapless, confused King Arthur and a Lancelet living in denial of his bisexual attraction to Arthur. Additionally, Christian fantasy fans have blasted the book for having anti-Christian sentiments, although the author herself was a Christian, they criticise that the book portrays Christianity as oppressive and anti-woman, and also includes sexual themes like incest, rape and mÃƒÂ©nage ÃƒÂ  trois.[4]\n\nIn Germany, Mists of Avalon has been included in the &quot;Bild Bestseller Bibliothek&quot; of the Bild, Germany&amp;#039;s highest-selling newspaper; it is a list of what Bild calls the 25 finest pieces of popular fiction of all time, alongside other classics like Shining or The Silence of the Lambs.\n\nBitRate 62 kbps\n\nSeed this man ! \n\nIf you take it check back now and then to make sure its seeded well. \n\nHelp Keep it alive.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e24f386036714680d7b8230ef64b4f77792978c6","amp;dn":"Marion+Zimmer+Bradley+Audiobook+collection+1+-+4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e24f386036714680d7b8230ef64b4f77792978c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,79,56,96,54,113,70,128,215,184,35,14,246,75,79,119,121,41,120,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
