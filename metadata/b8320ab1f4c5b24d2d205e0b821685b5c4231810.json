The second track off of their upcoming mixtape &quot;Shitfaced On Mars&quot;.\n\nTokers In Space consists of rapper Toker P and producer Backspacez\n\nThe single is called &quot;The Contract&quot; and it will be by Tokers In Space. Basically, Toker P's dad was going to kick him out of the house unless he signed a contract saying that he wouldn't smoke weed and if he did, his dad was going to kick him out and call the police. This is just him rapping about him trying to smoke without his dad finding out and stuff.\n\nIt's a boom bap styled beat with a funky bassline. Enjoy.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b8320ab1f4c5b24d2d205e0b821685b5c4231810","amp;dn":"%5BHip+Hop%5D+Tokers+In+Space+-+The+Contract+%5Bprod.+Backspacez%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b8320ab1f4c5b24d2d205e0b821685b5c4231810","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,50,10,177,244,197,178,77,45,32,94,11,130,22,133,181,196,35,24,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
