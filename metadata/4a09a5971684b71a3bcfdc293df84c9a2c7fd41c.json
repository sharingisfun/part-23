While fighting a Hollow, an evil spirit that preys on humans who display psychic energy, Rukia attempts to lend Ichigo some of her powers so that he can save his family; but much to her surprise, Ichigo absorbs every last drop of her energy. Now a full-fledged Soul Reaper himself, Ichigo quickly learns that the world he inhabits is one full of dangerous spirits and, along with Rukia - who is slowly regaining her powers - it's Ichigo's job to protect the innocent from Hollows and help the spirits themselves find peace.\n\nInfo Source: MyAnimeList\nDownload Source: Manga Traders","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4a09a5971684b71a3bcfdc293df84c9a2c7fd41c","amp;dn":"Bleach+-+Vol.+34","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4a09a5971684b71a3bcfdc293df84c9a2c7fd41c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,9,165,151,22,132,183,26,59,207,220,41,61,248,76,154,44,127,212,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
