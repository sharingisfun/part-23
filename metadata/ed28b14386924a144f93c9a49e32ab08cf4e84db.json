I&amp;#039;ve also added the dvd version with nightlife preinstalled, so that will cut down on installation a lot, it gets rid of 5 discs!\n\n* * * * *IMPORTANT!! * * * *\n\nFOLLOW THESE STEPS TO GET A PROBLEM-FREE INSTALLATION!\n\nIf something goes wrong, uninstall (one at a time, damn you EA &gt;.&lt;) and start over.)\n\n(SEED)\n\n1. Unrar\n\n2. Mount the image in the folder with (01) in it and install. Keys are listed below.\n\n3. Go on to (02), (03) and so on.\n\n4. Install the seasons patch (it&amp;#039;s called sims2ep5_patch_cd.exe)\n\n(KEEP SEEDING)\n\n5. After installing all expansions and the patch, copy Sims2EP5.exe from the crack/seasons folder and paste it into your TSBin directory of the Seasons install. In English, this should be something like C:/Program/EA GAMES/The Sims Seasons/TSBin\n\n6. Run the shortcut for the Seasons and enjoy. (You don&amp;#039;t need cracks for the stuff packs, only the newest expansion pack. When you run the stuff pack shortcuts it just tells you to run the one for the latest expansion pack &gt;.&lt; A+ to EA for that.)\n\nFYI: My computer is fairly fast, athlon 5200+ 2.8ghz, 10,000 rpm drive, 4gb ddr2, nvidia 8800 gts 640mb, and my computer sat for like 60 seconds at the loading screen before anything happened. I think this is just normal because it has all these expansions to process. My point is, when you first run the game, give it a good 5 minutes to load (not including the video) before you decide its broken.\n\n(DON&amp;#039;T STOP SEEDING)\n\nThe correct order of installation is as follows:\n\nThe Sims 2\n  9DMD-H4H3-PT2R-7EKC-V74A\n\nUniversity\n  QL22-Q976-4X8J-QMHX-22PB\n\nNightlife\n  (already installed with sims 2)\n\nHoliday (Christmas) Party Pack\n  No CD Key Needed\n\nOpen for Business\n  BPY8-4ZD4-LHYW-S57F-UZEK\n\nFamily Fun Stuff\n  F4EN-XDGJ-8HWJ-F8HV-MRLD\n\nGlamour Life Stuff\n  RYZ9-29RJ-A8J9-E1R0-1911\n\nPets\n  AHNW-MG5V-XBOX-LRLD-RULE\n\nHappy Holiday Stuff\n  No CD Key Needed\n\nSeasons\n  6DRZ-F33C-CWL4-TDL7-4UR6\n\nCelebration Stuff\n  JWW6-SSJQ-5LAN-T5LA-SRLD\n\nH&amp;M Fashion Stuff\n  68JA-SRST-VR32-4LPW-9HGA\n\nBon Voyage\n 1PH9-2Q1J-1111-G111-1FLT","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed28b14386924a144f93c9a49e32ab08cf4e84db","amp;dn":"Sims+2+Complete","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed28b14386924a144f93c9a49e32ab08cf4e84db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,40,177,67,134,146,74,20,79,147,201,164,158,50,171,8,207,78,132,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
