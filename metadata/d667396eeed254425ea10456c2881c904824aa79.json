To clone, use something like:\n\ngit clone git://github.com/psgroove/psgroove.git\ncd psgroove\ngit submodule init\ngit submodule update\nConfiguring\nChip and board selection can usually be handled in the Makefile. In particular, update the MCU, BOARD, and F_CPU lines. Suggested values:\n\nTeensy 1.0:\n\nMCU = at90usb162\nBOARD = TEENSY\nF_CLOCK = 16000000\nTeensy++ 1.0:\n\nMCU = at90usb646\nBOARD = TEENSY\nF_CLOCK = 16000000\nTeensy 2.0:\n\nMCU = atmega32u4\nBOARD = TEENSY\nF_CLOCK = 16000000\nTeensy++ 2.0:\n\nMCU = at90usb1286\nBOARD = TEENSY\nF_CLOCK = 16000000\nAT90USBKEY / AT90USBKEY2:\n\nMCU = at90usb1287\nBOARD = USBKEY\nF_CLOCK = 8000000\nBoard-specific notes\nTeensy boards only have one LED, so it will turn off when the exploit succeeds rather than turn green. Older Teensy 1.0 boards also have the polarity inverted. In general, a LED should do something when the board is powered, and do something different when the exploit works.\n\nBuilding\nOn Linux, use the AVR GCC toolchain (Debian/Ubuntu package: gcc-avr). On Windows, WinAVR should do the trick.\n\nmake clean\nmake\nProgramming\nNow program psgroove.hex into your board and you're ready to go. For the AT90USBKEY and other chips with a DFU bootloader preinstalled, you can get the dfu-programmer tool, put your board in programming mode, and run\n\nmake dfu\nFor the Teensy boards, you probably have to use the Teensy Loader software.\n\nUsing\nTo use this exploit:\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Hard power cycle your PS3 (using the switch in back, or unplug it)\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Plug the dongle into your PS3.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Press the PS3 power button, followed quickly by the eject button.\nAfter a few seconds, the first LED on your dongle should light up.
