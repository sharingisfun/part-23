But behind the facade of his success was a dark secret -- at every step of the way he was building the foundation for a cocaine empire that would grow to generate over $60 million in annual sales. Award-winning journalist Mark Bowden tells the saga of Lavin's rise and fall with the gripping, novelistic narrative style that won him international acclaim as the author of the New York Times best-seller Black Hawk Down.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:370774ae05455cbab1cc687f02ffebd9b133bb8e","amp;dn":"Doctor+Dealer%3A+The+Rise+and+Fall+of+an+All-American+Boy+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"370774ae05455cbab1cc687f02ffebd9b133bb8e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,7,116,174,5,69,92,186,177,204,104,127,2,255,235,217,177,51,187,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
