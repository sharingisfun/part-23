While retaining elements of their metal heritage, their music grew increasingly complex, with much longer tracks and interesting interwoven melodic elements added. They merged their love of YES and RUSH, by combining elements of pure metal, classically inspired crescendos and interludes with jazz fusion like chops. FW has been largely responsible for the infusion of progressive thinking into heavy metal music, unlike its co-founding compatriots of progressive metal, DREAM THEATER. So give yourself the chance to live an emotive experience unlike anything else.\nLike KING CRIMSON, the evolution of FATES WARNING can be split into many different period. &quot;Awaken The Guardian&quot; (1986) showed the band's music to be more progressive and complex that first impressions had suggested. &quot;No Exit&quot; (1988) was a ground breaking album for the band as they further explore the realms of progressive metal with the 21 minute long &quot;The Ivory Gate of Dreams&quot;. This was followed by &quot;Perfect Symmetry&quot; (1989), considered by many to be the band's most Progressive rock-driven release. The compilation, &quot;Chasing Time&quot;, is a great place to start. However, 1998's &quot;A Pleasant Shade Of Grey&quot;, which consists of a single 40-minute song, is clearly the best place for a Progressive rock fan. The album start off slowly and needs several careful listenings to be fully appreciated; but then, since part. &quot;Still Life&quot; appeared the next year, and &quot;Disconnected&quot; followed two years later. And now let's wait for their 2003 release.\nÃâ€ÃÂ¾ÃÂ¿.
