I completely understand why you would download it first, whether its you don't have the money ATM or if its the fact you want to know what you are buying and if you like it.\n\nSo please buy it and delete your downloaded files... especially these kind of bands when they are almost unknown, and remember no record sales = no tour = no money = No new albums.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ede9c03813ce3336c8a75b50d4162b41aaa8c23d","amp;dn":"Where+Death+Is+Most+Alive+%282009%29-2DVD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ede9c03813ce3336c8a75b50d4162b41aaa8c23d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,233,192,56,19,206,51,54,200,167,91,80,212,22,43,65,170,168,194,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
