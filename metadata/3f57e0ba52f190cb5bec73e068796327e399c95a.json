This is actually a very well made film. Parts of the film seem compromised to the extent that it was influenced by American Cinema, but the film exposes aspects of Jamaican culture that i&amp;#039;m sure many aren&amp;#039;t familiar with. Also, the Jamaican/Rastafarian vernacular, though it is a little tough to pick up on upon first hearing it, is very beautiful and poetic. This film conveys the idea that we should love and help out eachother, an idea rarely found in modern Western cinema anymore. This is one of the only movies I really even like anymore. Also, this film has an excellent soundtrack and quite possibly the best kung-fu scene ever! \nThe soundtrack is a bit out of the ordinary, there is some great reggae and dub track and of course a lot of ganja smoking.\nSo if you like reggaemusic this is a movie for you garanteed...\nSeed this torrent when you have download it...\nPeace...\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f57e0ba52f190cb5bec73e068796327e399c95a","amp;dn":"Countryman.+Avi+1982","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f57e0ba52f190cb5bec73e068796327e399c95a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,87,224,186,82,241,144,203,91,236,115,224,104,121,99,39,227,153,201,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
