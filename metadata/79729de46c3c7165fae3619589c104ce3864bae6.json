More than any other Jamaican production stable, Studio One was a crucial force during the 1960s and 70s, being the true home of ska and a hugely important site of early reggae.\nLondonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Soul Jazz began an association with Studio One founder Clement Dodd during the 1990s, helping to introduce this great music to a whole new audience. DoddÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s death interrupted the release schedule, but Studio One Sound shows that things are back on track. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a sublime set of little-known material from the labelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s heyday.\n\nIt opens with Hip Hug, Slim SmithÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wonderful rock steady dance tune, which is followed by the extraordinary funk-roots of Good People, an exceptionally rare 1979 offering from Ras Michael and the Sons of Negus. Lord TanamoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Keep on Moving is an alternate take of Jackie MittooÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Totally Together, and The Wailing SoulsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Trouble Maker has the harmonic brilliance that made their name. Elsewhere, Rita MarleyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Call to Me reminds of her early renown, and Johnny OsbourneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s All I Have Is Love is absolutely chilling. But the cheesy version of Smokey RobinsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s I Second That Emotion is pure novelty-value stuff Ã¢â‚¬â€œ credited to The Martinis, it features Bajan singer Emile Straker.More noteworthy highlights include Irvin BrownÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s falsetto party tune, Run Come, The HeptonesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ stunning Give Give Love, Jackie OpelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ska-gospel The Lord Is With Me, and Ken BootheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s heartbroken I Am a Fool. Larry MarshallÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s take on The GayladsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a Fire is full of emotion, and Freddie McGregorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wonderful Homeward Bound is yet another standout, as are a few splendid instrumentals.\n\nLiner notes by discographer Rob Chapman add context, albeit despite minor errors, and the sound quality is occasionally a bit muffled. Also, why a photo of Dennis Brown during his A&amp;M phase was chosen for the front cover, when he does not appear on the disc, is something of a mystery. But the exceptional track selection, masterfully chosen by Oxman of Dub Vendor, makes this one a winner in every sense.~Natalie Shaw\n\n''Almighty 18-track Soul Jazz set of classic ska 'n' deep dub-roots from the Studio One vaults!''\n\n01.
