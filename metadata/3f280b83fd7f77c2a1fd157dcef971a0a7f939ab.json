Richard Basehart stars as a cold-blooded thief whose murder of a police officer sets off a citywide manhunt; the law, led by granite-jawed Scott Brady, tracks him relentlessly until the pair square off in the shadow-steeped drainage canals beneath the city (the same locale for the finale of Them!). Though Alfred Werker is credited as director, noir and Western vet Anthony Mann actually helmed the majority of the film; his muscular direction lends palpable suspense to the picture, aided in no small part by longtime collaborators John C. Higgins (who co-wrote the script) and cinematographer John Alton, whose Germanic-influenced lighting creates an otherworldly atmosphere. Supporting cast member Jack Webb borrowed the no-nonsense, semi-documentary approach for Dragnet. --Paul Gaita\n\n\nFile Name .........................................: He Walked by\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 941,957,120 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 1:18:54\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nFrame Size ......................................: 640x464 (AR: 1.379)\nFPS .................................................: 23.976\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 1454 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.204 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [], [], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 128 kb/s [2 channel(s)] CBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1\n\n\nEnglish audio.
