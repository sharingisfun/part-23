Mostly it has to do with them being slapped together from a PC version and forcing all the versatility of a mouse and keyboard onto a handful of buttons on a console controller. Admittedly the concern was there in checking out World of Conflict on the 360, but within a short while of playing the game, it seemed much more palpable than any other RTS weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve seen on a console. Apart from the controls, World in Conflict: Soviet Assault features a bunch of new single-player campaign missions, played from the point of view of the Ruskies. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not a seperate campaign, as these missions are intersperced among the US campaign of the first game, but it does help to tell a fuller story for people who missed out. Apart from those missions, though, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s pretty much the same solid content that was on the PC version. The controls are really the focus of the port, so thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll be our focus here. The analog sticks handle all your camera movement, moving it around as you would in an FPS like Halo or Call of Duty. This allows you to move around the map much faster than normal, which is pretty crucial for a strategy game. Important tasks like select, target and attack are all on the A button, which makes sending your troops into battle a lot easier. There is a pretty brilliant new mass-select option, though. Clicking in the right stick pulls up a circle on the screen, and anyone inside of the circle will be selected with a click. You can even change the size of the circle for larger or smaller selections, if you wish. Compare this to most games, where you have to drag a cumbersome box around your units, and itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a helluva lot easier. You can also set squad shortcuts. Say you want all your jeeps and infantry to move together? Select the ones you want and hold down a direction on the d-pad to set that group. From then on, tapping that direction will select them, and double tapping will bring your camera over to them. This makes giving orders to multiple groups pretty freakinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ easy. Lastly thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s voice controls, which allow you to literally call in new units. Just pull up your reinforcements page with the right bumper and shout into the mic to call in tanks, artillery or whatever else you need. Of course you can always just use the analog stick to select your units, but calling them in is so much cooler, donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t ya think? World in Conflict: Soviet Assault may actually work out as an RTS on the console. It still needs some tweaks in the controls department (theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re a little sensitive at the moment), but overall its looking pretty promising. WeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll be following up with Sierra at E3 to check in on its progress.\nWorld.in.Conflict.Soviet.Assault\n\n\n\nGracias por visitar www EspaTorrents com\nThank you for visit www EspaTorrents com\n\n\n\ndo you want more games &amp; cine-online in good-quality???\n\n&amp; www.espaendirecto.com\n\nThanks!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:782029b1719a46f1c5c9c7ae91426d1fe54d4746","amp;dn":"World.in.Conflict.Soviet.Assault-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"782029b1719a46f1c5c9c7ae91426d1fe54d4746","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,32,41,177,113,154,70,241,197,201,199,174,145,66,109,31,229,77,71,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
