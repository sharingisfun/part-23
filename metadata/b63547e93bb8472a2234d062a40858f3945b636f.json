The first few seem to be from his YouTube shows, as opposed to his BlogTV or Vaughn shows. The last two seem to be from his BlogTV shows. I mainly recorded these because I wanted him to say funny stuff (like having him pretend to be Obama). The last two are really long, and the last one is probably an entire show (or around 95% of one).\n\nThese recordings start from September 2nd, 2012, at 10:52 PM (11:52 PM Randy's time) and end at March 25, 2013, at 6:14 PM (7:14 PM Randy's time). All files are in .mp3 format.\n\nThe reason why the filenames all begin with &quot;Google Chrome&quot; is because the program I used to record the audio uses the program it is recording from as part of the file name, and I watch Randy's shows in Google Chrome.\n\n&quot;Google Chrome 20120902 2052&quot; - Randy re-enacts a SpongeBob episode. 55 seconds.\n\n&quot;Google Chrome 20120902 2057&quot; - Randy talks about how people accuse him of copying other people. 1 minute 45 seconds.\n\n&quot;Google Chrome 20120902 2059&quot; - Randy talks some more about people accusing him of copying. He also pretends to be Barack Obama (that's why I recorded this). 1 minute 5 seconds.\n\n&quot;Google Chrome 20120902 2112&quot; - Randy talks about his early YouTube career and various YouTubers. 10 minutes 48 seconds.\n\n&quot;Google Chrome 20120902 2123&quot; - Randy talks about Twitter, the Whale, shirts, and games. 8 minutes 43 seconds.\n\n&quot;Google Chrome 20120902 2131&quot; - Randy talks about YouTubers, video games, anime, and television. 7 minutes 13 seconds.\n\n&quot;Google Chrome 20120902 2139&quot; - Randy talks about music, chairs, instruments, communicating with fans. This is also the ending of the entire live show for September 2nd, 2012. 9 minutes 7 seconds.\n\n&quot;Google Chrome 20130101 2132&quot; - Seems to begin in the middle of the show. Fairly laggy as well. I recorded until the end of this show from January 1st, 2013. 1 hour 47 minutes 23 seconds.\n\n&quot;Google Chrome 20130325 1814&quot; - Begins a bit into the show as Randy is talking about a YouTube magazine he made when he was younger. This was Randy's last show on BlogTV. I recorded until the end of this show from March 25th, 2013. 5 hours 36 minutes 48 seconds (but the last 2 and a half minutes are dead air).\n\nEnjoy!\n\nSincerely,\nThe PioneersProductions Archivist\n - imatu - ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b63547e93bb8472a2234d062a40858f3945b636f","amp;dn":"PioneersProductions+Live+Shows+Audio+Recordings","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b63547e93bb8472a2234d062a40858f3945b636f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,53,71,233,59,184,71,42,34,52,208,98,164,8,88,243,148,91,99,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
