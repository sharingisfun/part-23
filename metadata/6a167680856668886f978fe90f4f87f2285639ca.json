Church and Gary Stearman.\n\nProphecy In The News Ministry Statement of Faith reads as follows:\n\nWe are often asked for a Statement of Faith. Indeed, it is a question that ought to be asked, for the Bible tells us to Ã¢â‚¬Å“try the spirits whether they are of GodÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (I John 4:1), and we gladly offer this declaration:\n\n 1. We believe in God, revealed in three persons Ã¢â‚¬â€œ God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit.\n\n 2. We believe that Jesus Christ, the only begotten Son of God, was born of a virgin, lived a sinless life, died on the cross to atone for our transgressions, and rose again on the third day.  He ascended into Heaven with a promise to return some day.\n\n 3. We believe that it is solely by the grace of God that man, as a condemned sinner, receives salvation through faith in Jesus Christ to forgive sin.  Only then are we held blameless by the Father.  Faith in Jesus Christ saves us from a literal hell, for a literal, eternal Heaven.\n\n 4. We believe the Bible is the verbally inspired, infallible Word of God, inerrant in its original manuscripts.  The Scriptures should be dispensationally interpreted.\n\n 5. We believe the Bible clearly teaches that Jesus Christ is coming again Ã¢â‚¬â€œ first in the air to resurrect those believers who have died and to rapture those who are still alive.  His coming may occur at any moment prior to the Tribulation Period.\n\n 6. We believe in the visible, personal, premillennial return of Jesus Christ to the earth at the close of the Great Tribulation.  He will establish His kingdom and reign for 1,000 years.  Afterward, we shall enter the Holy City, New Jerusalem, where we shall live and serve God throughout eternity.\n\n 7. We believe in GodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s promise of eternal life for the saved and His warning of eternal damnation for the lost.\n\nIf you, dear friend, have not yet come to a saving knowledge of Jesus Christ as your own personal Savior, we would count it a privilege to pray with you on this most important decision of your life.  You have only to ask...\n\n\nOther Prophecy In The News Magazine issues from 1997 to 2005 have all been scanned in 600 dpi resolution, however each page is being individually straightened, trimmed and healed using Photoshop and then converted to PDF with OCR so the text is searchable, and therefore, will take some time before all those issues are ready for upload.  In addition, because the OCR is overlaid on the original cleaned up scanned pages to more accurately preserve the original appearance, the PDF sizes are much larger than these PDFs are which come from the original source and not from scanned pages.  Those earlier PDFs are about 1GB in size.  I have tried to reduce the PDFs in Acrobat Professional, however, even though the sizes were reduced to about 15 MB, that reduction removed too much detail from the high resolution scans and made the text fuzzy.  Therefore, I will probably be retaining the original size to preserve the clear readable details of each page.\n\nWhen the 1997-2005 issues are finished, those issues will also be available for download at a later date on http://conspiracyhub.com/ assuming others will use that site, and support it so it will not be shut down at a later date due to lack of interest and support.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a167680856668886f978fe90f4f87f2285639ca","amp;dn":"Prophecy+In+The+News+Magazines+%282006-2014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a167680856668886f978fe90f4f87f2285639ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,22,118,128,133,102,104,136,111,151,143,233,15,79,135,242,40,86,57,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
