The light-in-the-darkness of Dave Koz's &quot;Memories of a Winter \nNight&quot; is inspiring, while the passionate voice of Neshama Cablebach on &quot;A \nLove Transcending&quot; seems to emanate from the candles themselves. There's \nlaughter, too, as in the inevitable holiday relationship tangle in &quot;Feast of \nLights&quot; by They Might Be Giants. More traditional sounds are offered by The \nKlezmatics in &quot;I'm Going to Take My Shoes Off,&quot; and vocalist Chava \nAlbertstein's heartrending supplication. Sephardic music is embellished with an \nambient groove on Victor E. Friedberg's &quot;Continuo -- La Mujer de Terah,&quot; \nfeaturing historic samples of the voice of Berta Aguado. Angelic chanting \ngives an ethereal atmosphere to Wayne Horvitz and Robin Holcomb's &quot;Mah \nL'kha Ha-Yam Variation.&quot; Jazz saxophone, big band, and a Dylan-like folk \nsong sung by Peter Himmelman are just a few of the other styles to savor. \nAnd last, but certainly not least, is Frank London's evocative &quot;Song of \nPraise,&quot; a swirling mixture of muted trumpets, plucked lute, keyboard drones, \nand Middle Eastern percussion. FESTIVAL OF LIGHT 2 is sure to fire up your \nHannukah festivities.\n\nAll Music Guide - Steve Huey\nFestival of Light, Vol. 2 is an equally satisfying follow-up to the \ngroundbreaking Hanukkah holiday compilation, capturing traditional and non-\ntraditional musical takes on the season ranging from humorous and \ncelebratory to ethereal, solemn, and spiritual. The generally subdued musical \nfeel is broken at times by more boisterous offerings from the Klezmatics, the \nFrank London Big Band, and They Might Be Giants, for example; differing \nstyles abound, including world music, rock, new age/contemporary \ninstrumental, folk, klezmer, smooth jazz, electronic dance music, and \ntraditional hymns, which gives the disc an amazing variety.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBTW - IndoEuro and the other antisemites can keep their fucking comments off of this torrent\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:89928d1508368d6f7b556087f11007058ba1855b","amp;dn":"Chanukkah+Music+-+Festival+of+Light+2+%5BV2%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"89928d1508368d6f7b556087f11007058ba1855b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,146,141,21,8,54,141,111,123,85,96,135,241,16,7,5,139,161,133,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
