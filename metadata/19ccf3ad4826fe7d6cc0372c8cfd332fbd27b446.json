Hotter Reggae Music - Welton Irie\n---------------------------------------\nAmazon.com\nWith so many hip-hop headz and funk nostalgists digging deeper into the record crates for the real thing, labels such as the U.K.&amp;#039;s Soul Jazz have begun packaging dancehall for the new generation. On the other hand, premier reggae historian Steve Barrow--whose career of repackaging reggae for American and British audiences includes the landmark four-CD Tougher Than Tough box set--uses Darker Than Blue: Soul from Jamdown to turn the mirror around, examining Jamaican bands covering American funk. The fine selection includes covers of songs written by Americans already indelibly influenced by reggae, including Carl Bradney&amp;#039;s cover of War&amp;#039;s &quot;Slipping into Darkness&quot; and Tinga Stewart&amp;#039;s cover of Timmy Thomas&amp;#039;s &quot;Why Can&amp;#039;t We Live Together?&quot; Others are completely Jamaicanized versions of the originals, as in the Tamlins&amp;#039; cover of Randy Newman&amp;#039;s &quot;Baltimore&quot; and the unforgettable title track, Lloyd Charmers&amp;#039;s dubwise rendering of Curtis Mayfield&amp;#039;s classic. Welton Irie&amp;#039;s &quot;Hotter Reggae Music&quot; borrows generous helpings of &quot;Rapper&amp;#039;s Delight,&quot; a case of history coming full circle. Highly recommended. --Jeff Chang ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:19ccf3ad4826fe7d6cc0372c8cfd332fbd27b446","amp;dn":"Darker+Than+Blue-+Soul+From+Jamdown+1973-1980","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"19ccf3ad4826fe7d6cc0372c8cfd332fbd27b446","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,204,243,173,72,38,254,125,108,192,55,44,140,253,51,47,189,39,180,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
