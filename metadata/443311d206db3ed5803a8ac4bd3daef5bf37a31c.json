Guided through their journey by a pair known only as Dr. Robert (Bono) and Mr. Kite (Eddie Izzard), Jude and Lucy are eventually forced to find their way back to one another after being split apart by powerful forces beyond their control. The music in the film consists exclusively of songs made popular by the Beatles during the time period depicted in the movie. \n\nRipped with DVD Decrypter and Autogk.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:443311d206db3ed5803a8ac4bd3daef5bf37a31c","amp;dn":"Across+The+Universe%282007%29DVDRip.AC3%28ENG%29-DROCK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"443311d206db3ed5803a8ac4bd3daef5bf37a31c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,51,17,210,6,219,62,213,128,58,138,196,189,61,174,245,191,55,163,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
