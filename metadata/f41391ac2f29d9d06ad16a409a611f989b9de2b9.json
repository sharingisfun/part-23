Released on March 10, 2009, it marked a shift from Cornell's previous musical efforts with the exclusion of some guitar and rock elements that were replaced with producer Timbaland's electronic pop soundscapes. The album was promoted with the release of five digital singles and three music videos, and was met with mostly negative reviews. The album debuted in the U.S at number 10 on the Billboard 200 with 26,000 copies sold.\n\nTrack listing\n\n    * Chris Cornell co-wrote all of the songs on the album; additional writers are listed below.\n\nNo. \tTitle \tWriter(s) \tAdditional Production \tLength\n1. \t&quot;Part of Me&quot;   \tTimothy Mosley, Jerome Harmon, Johnkenun Spivery, Ezekiel Lewis, Balewa Muhammad \tCo-produced with Johnkenun Spivery\nBacking Vocals: Timbaland, Ezekiel Lewis and Jim Beanz \t5:14\n2. \t&quot;Time&quot;   \tMosley, Harmon, James Washington, Lewis, Muhammad \tBacking Vocals: Ezekiel Lewis &amp; Jim Beanz\nCo-produced with Jim Beanz \t4:39\n3. \t&quot;Sweet Revenge&quot;   \tMosley, Harmon, Washington, James Fauntleroy \tBacking Vocals: James Fauntleroy and Jim Beanz \t4:10\n4. \t&quot;Get Up&quot;   \tMosley, Harmon, Washington, Fauntleroy \tBacking Vocals: James Fauntleroy and Jim Beanz \t3:35\n5. \t&quot;Ground Zero&quot;   \tMosley, Harmon, Washington \tBacking Vocals: Jim Beanz\nCo-produced with Jim Beanz \t3:09\n6. \t&quot;Never Far Away&quot;   \tMosley, Harmon, Washington, Ryan Tedder, Lewis, Muhammad \tCo-produced with Ryan Tedder\nBacking Vocals: Ezekiel Lewis, Ryan Tedder and Jim Beanz \t5:06\n7. \t&quot;Take Me Alive&quot;   \tMosley, Harmon, Washington, Justin Timberlake \tBacking Vocals: Justin Timberlake and Jim Beanz \t4:36\n8. \t&quot;Long Gone&quot; (Featuring Timbaland) \tMosley, Harmon, Tedder, Lewis, Patrick &quot;J.
