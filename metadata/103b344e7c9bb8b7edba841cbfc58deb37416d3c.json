He studied under Plato at Athens and taught there (367ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“347); subsequently he spent three years at the court of a former pupil, Hermeias, in Asia Minor and at this time married Pythias, one of Hermeias's relations. After some time at Mitylene, in 343ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“2 he was appointed by King Philip of Macedon to be tutor of his teen-aged son Alexander. After Philip's death in 336, Aristotle became head of his own school (of 'Peripatetics'), the Lyceum at Athens. Because of anti-Macedonian feeling there after Alexander's death in 323, he withdrew to Chalcis in Euboea, where he died in 322.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:103b344e7c9bb8b7edba841cbfc58deb37416d3c","amp;dn":"Aristotle%3A+Minor+Works","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"103b344e7c9bb8b7edba841cbfc58deb37416d3c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,59,52,78,124,155,184,183,237,186,132,28,191,197,141,235,55,65,109,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
