In his late teens, he was a devotee of Sri Ramana Maharshi in Tiruvannamalai, India. In later life Robert Adams held satsang with a small group of devotees in California, US.[2] He mainly advocated the path of jÃ±Äna yoga with an emphasis on the practice of self-enquiry.\r\n\r\nRobert Adams' teachings were not that well known in his lifetime, but have since been widely circulated amongst those investigating the philosophy of Advaita and the Western devotees of Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi. A book of his teachings, Silence of the Heart: Dialogues with Robert Adams, was published in 1999.\r\n\r\nThe audio here are the recording of the satsang talks he delivered to a small group of devotees","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ff89616a358d9e6e8d7cb17b0f919caa5125857","amp;dn":"Robert+Adams+Ramana+Maharshi+Satsang","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ff89616a358d9e6e8d7cb17b0f919caa5125857","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,248,150,22,163,88,217,230,232,215,203,23,176,249,25,202,165,18,88,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
