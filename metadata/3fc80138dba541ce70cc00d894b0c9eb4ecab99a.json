It should never be lost. This movie, and also Excalibur, came out in the same year, when I was 11 years old, and they both have captivated my imagination since their release. They must be kept alive!\n\nThis movie is ripped from original DVD, in DVD format (not re-encoded). I had to compress it to .rar for the site to accept its size. Just uncompress it, place the files in a folder named VIDEO_TS, and your dvd player should read it and play it just fine.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3fc80138dba541ce70cc00d894b0c9eb4ecab99a","amp;dn":"Dragonslayer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3fc80138dba541ce70cc00d894b0c9eb4ecab99a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,200,1,56,219,165,65,206,112,204,0,216,148,176,201,235,78,202,185,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
