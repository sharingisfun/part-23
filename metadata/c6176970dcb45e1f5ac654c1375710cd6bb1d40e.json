The Gestapo were able to detect the smallest signs of non-compliance with Nazi doctrines, especially &quot;crimes&quot; pertaining to the private spheres of social, family, and sexual life. One of the key factors in the enforcement of Nazi policies was the willingness of German citizens to provide the authorities with information about suspected &quot;criminality&quot;.
