Clearly, vocalist Chris McCaddon, drummer Mark Garza, and guitarist Andy Godwin shared a musical bond unbroken by time, space, and circumstances.\n\nThe members aren?t doing The Famine as a way to exhume Embodyment?s corpse. Rather, The Famine represents a new and broader territory the members want to explore. McCaddon finishes, ?This is a new chapter for us, personally and musically. We?re not trying to regurgitate the past. And we don?t want to do a disservice to what The Famine is trying to do.? And what is The Famine trying to do? Easy. Make intelligent, yet insurgent metal that scorches the earth with its intensity and ferocity.&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.the-famine.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.the-famine.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n320kbit","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:82cf8f30e4abf03db45b90aace1eda58bc2fb238","amp;dn":"The+Famine+-+The+Raven+and+the+Reaping+%282008%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"82cf8f30e4abf03db45b90aace1eda58bc2fb238","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,207,143,48,228,171,240,61,180,91,144,170,206,30,218,88,188,47,178,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
