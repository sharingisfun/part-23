Cuffy is now the centre of attention as he mopes around Shillingbury with a permanently grubby coat, flat cap and stubble - although underneath it all, he has a heart of gold.\n\nOther Shillingbury Tales cast members reprising earlier roles include Jack Douglas as farmer Jake, Linda Hayden as his daughter Mandy, and Nigel Lambert as the Reverend Norris; Diana King now features as local spinster Mrs. Simkins, also featuring guest appearances from Gareth Hunt and Beryl Reid.\n\nCuffy was written by the multi-talented producer/director/writer Francis Essex, best known for bringing The Muppet Show to British TV but also a noted composer whose themes include FollyfootÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s celebrated The Lightning Tree (as Steven Francis).\n\n6 x 25 minutes episodes:\n\n\n    1. Cuffy And A Carpetbagger (13 March 1983)\n    2. Cuffy And A Holiday (20 March 1983)\n    3. Cuffy And A Fashion Show (27 March 1983)\n    4. Cuffy And A Downpour (3 April 1983)\n    5.
