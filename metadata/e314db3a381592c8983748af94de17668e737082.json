This quintet made some of the best and most complex music from Scandinavian countries on their first two albums sometimes making you think of CRIMSON and TASAVALLAN PRESIDENTTI, but they sing in Finnish. Their third album was a private (self-produced) pressing affair that veered to a much heavier rock. Recently, two more albums have been released and the rumour has it that they are in the same vein although only their multi-instrumentalist leader Vesa Lattunen remains from the 70's line-up. Nevertheless their first two albums should be considered by progheads as minor classic and are likely to appeal to everyone concerned. -Prog Archives\n\n\nHaikara  (1972, RCA Records)\nGeafar  (1974, RCA Records)\nIso lintu  (1976, Satsanga Records)\nDomino  (1998, Metamorphosis)\nTuhkamaa  (2001, Mellow Records)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e314db3a381592c8983748af94de17668e737082","amp;dn":"Haikara+%28progressive+rock%2C+1971-2001%2C+Finland%2C+album+discography","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e314db3a381592c8983748af94de17668e737082","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,20,219,58,56,21,146,200,152,55,72,175,148,222,23,102,142,115,112,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
