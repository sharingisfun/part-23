The Fantastic Four and Spider-Man have always been deeply intertwined in both the comics and Marvel history, and Gage looks at the burgeoning friendship between all the members of the FF and Spidey over the course of several eras (again, much like the X-Men limited series). There are great battles with Namor, Doctor Doom, the Venom symbiote and the Skrulls along with quieter scenes such as Spider-Man's admiration of Reed Richards, his treatment and respect of Sue, his quips and banter with Johnny and (almost!) a poker game with Ben Grimm. Alberti's art is more hit and miss this time around but gets the job done, and his action work is superb. This digital copy is thanks to Minutemen-InnerDemons. Please seed, enjoy! :-)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:80eebd285d680354e297e1d31f095411b3df503f","amp;dn":"Spider-Man+and+the+Fantastic+Four+01-04+%282010%7CDgtl%7CMM-ID%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"80eebd285d680354e297e1d31f095411b3df503f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,238,189,40,93,104,3,84,226,151,225,211,31,9,84,17,179,223,80,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
