One such record was issued each year from 1963 to 1969\n\nConceived as a means to appease fan-club members whose letters, due to their sheer volume, were not always being answered in a timely manner, the records included the Beatles' messages of thanks to &quot;loyal Beatle people&quot;, along with skits, Christmas carols, and original compositions.\n\n1967: Christmas Time is Here Again! [320k MP3]\n\n    Recorded: 28 November 1967\n    Location: EMI Studios, London\n    Writer: The Beatles\n    Producer: George Martin\n    Issued: 15 December 1967\n    Label: Lyntone, LYN 1360\n    Flexi disc: 7&quot;, 1 side, 33Ã¢â€¦â€œ RPM\n    Total time: 6:06\n\nAn elaborate production, Christmas Time is Here Again! was developed around the concept of several groups auditioning for a BBC radio show. The title song serves as a refrain throughout the record. The Beatles portray a multitude of characters, including game show contestants, aspiring musicians (&quot;Plenty of Jam Jars&quot;, by the Ravellers), and actors in a radio drama (&quot;Theatre Hour&quot;). At the end John reads a poem, &quot;When Christmas Time Is Over.&quot; This offering was likely a deliberate homage to/continuation of the broadly similar &quot;Craig Torso&quot; specials produced for BBC Radio 1 that same year by the Beatles' friends and collaborators the Bonzo Dog Doo Dah Band, and also shares much in common with their then-unreleased track &quot;You Know My Name (Look Up The Number)&quot;, recorded six months previously.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4da52d9dd252105591aff8d49ad877ed077a8d3e","amp;dn":"The+Beatles+-+Christmas+Time+Is+Here+Again+%5B320k+MP3%5D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4da52d9dd252105591aff8d49ad877ed077a8d3e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,165,45,157,210,82,16,85,145,175,248,212,154,216,119,237,7,122,141,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
