It is possible to delete the entire computer including the system partition without boot media. After restarting the system the deletion process begins automatically. Should an SSD not support TRIM, the data is simply overwritten with zeros to avoid wear effects.\nWhen surfing the Internet, your browser usually stores Internet files on your hard disk unnoticed. These files can provide information about\n websites youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve visited or the passwords youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve entered. Makes no difference whether it involves cookies, data entered on forms, or browsing history Ã¢â‚¬â€œ O&amp;O SafeErase lists all the information saved for each browser you use, and you can then SafeErase them individually or as a bundle. Once deleted, nobody will be able to detect your Internet activity and your online accounts are protected from unauthorized access.\nO&amp;O SafeErase allows you to choose from among six different deletion methods. The methods of deletion differ in the number of runs and the type of overwriting process. These methods ensure maximum security, whatever your requirements. In addition to standardized deletion methods of the U. S. Department of Defense (DoD) and the German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) you can also select a complex mathematical method (Gutmann method), which is en par with the highest security levels. In this scientifically approved method of data deletion, corresponding areas of the hard disk are overwritten 35 times using precisely defined rules along with fixed and random values. In this way, O&amp;O SafeErase exceeds even the requirements of the DoD and the BSI. Quick deletion can also be made by just overwriting data with zeros.\n\nInfo:\n\n- Disconnect net.\n- Install.\n- Use Keygen to register.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.iv.pl/images/37863761368469221787.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.iv.pl/images/37863761368469221787.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:362fb5c7c45bb820bd3152f226f95221cfcafef5","amp;dn":"O%26amp%3BO+SafeErase+Pro+7.0.165+%28x32%2Fx64%29+%5BENG%5D+%5BKeygen%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"362fb5c7c45bb820bd3152f226f95221cfcafef5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,47,181,199,196,91,184,32,189,49,82,242,38,249,82,33,207,202,254,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
