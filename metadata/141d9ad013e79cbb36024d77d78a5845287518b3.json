The first two discs contain their entire studio output, including the albums Unknown Pleasures and Closer, along with singles and compilation appearances. Discs three and four collect rare demos and live recordings, many of which were previously unreleased. All tracks are digitally remastered. It's the third highest ranked compilation album of all time on rateyourmusic.com.[\n\nAmazon.com Review By Jerry McCulley - Though Joy Division's anxious, angular songs echoed time-honored art-school obsessions from the Doors through Eno, they never stooped to cheap nostalgia or pretentious condescension. Neither bridge nor battering ram, the band's music--haunting and hypnotic, with an emotionally naked core as bleak as it was compelling--has transcended disposable pop culture past and present; leader-vocalist Ian Curtis's 1980 suicide only underscored the notion that Joy Division was a band out of time, figuratively as well as literally. In just over two years, the Manchester, U.K., group constructed a legacy whose influences have surfaced with the surviving members' New Order through macabre, psychically-damaged Curtis/Cobain parallels to the sonic atmospherics of Radiohead. And if their recorded output was limited, it has long been ill served by the record industry's worst Cuisinart instincts. Thus, this artfully designed four-disc, 81-track box should reign as the band's definitive recorded history. Journalist Jon Savage collaborated with band members Bernard Sumner and Peter Hook to assemble Joy Division's legacy into four subtly different chapters. Discs one and two center around the band's albums, Unknown Pleasures and Closer respectively, culling singles, demos, and outtakes. Disc three gathers BBC and Peel sessions and more than a dozen previously unreleased outtakes. The final chapter may be the most artistically revealing: 17 live tracks that represent not only the best of the band's darkly compelling songs, but show their riveting stage presence during a performance peak that spanned but seven months. The accompanying booklet presents an almost Rashomon-like take on the band, from its spare, impressionistic imagery through its multiple essays and, crucially, the lyrics of Ian Curtis, starkly presented as the candid, disquieting poetry that was the essence of Joy Division's murmuring heart and troubled soul.\n\n\nTrack Listings \n\n\nDisc 01\n\n[01] Digital\n[02] Glass\n[03] Disorder\n[04] Day Of The Lords\n[05] Candidate\n[06] Insight\n[07] New Dawn Fades\n[08] She's Lost Control\n[09] Shadowplay\n[10] Wilderness\n[11] Interzone\n[12] I Remember Nothing\n[13] Ice Age\n[14] Exercise One\n[15] Transmission\n[16] Novelty\n[17] The Kill\n[18] The Only Mistake\n[19] Something Must Break\n[20] Auto-Suggestion\n[21] From Safety To Where...?\n\n\tDisc 01 Play Time 01h:17m:28s\n\nDisc 02 \n\n[01] She's Lost Control (12&quot; Mix)\n[02] The Sound Of Music\n[03] Atmosphere\n[04] Dead Souls\n[05] Komakino\n[06] Incubation\n[07] Atrocity Exhibition\n[08] Isolation\n[09] Passover\n[10] Colony\n[11] Means To An End\n[12] Heart And Soul\n[13] Twenty Four Hours\n[14] The Eternal\n[15] Decades\n[16] Love Will Tear Us Apart\n[17] These Days\n\n\tDisc 02 Play Time 01h:16m:02s\n\n\n\nDisc 03 \n\n[01] Warsaw\n[02] No Love Lost\n[03] Leaders Of Men\n[04] Failures\n[05] The Drawback (RCA Demo)\n[06] Interzone (RCA Demo)\n[07] Shadowplay (RCA Demo)\n[08] Exercise One\n[09] Insight\n[10] Glass\n[11] Transmission\n[12] Dead Souls\n[13] Something Must Break\n[14] Ice Age\n[15] Walked In Line\n[16] These Days\n[17] Candidate\n[18] The Only Mistake\n[19] Chance (Atmosphere)\n[20] Love Will Tear Us Apart\n[21] Colony\n[22] As You Said\n[23] Ceremony\n[24] In A Lonely Place (Detail)\n\n\tDisc 03 Play Time 01h:17m:51s\n\nDisc 04 \n\t\n[01] Dead Souls\n[02] The Only Mistake\n[03] Insight\n[04] Candidate\n[05] Wilderness\n[06] She's Lost Control\n[07] Disorder\n[08] Interzone\n[09] Atrocity Exhibition\n[10] Novelty\n[11] Autosuggestion\n[12] I Remember Nothing\n[13] Colony\n[14] These Days\n[15] Incubation\n[16] The Eternal\n[17] Heart And Soul\n[18] Isolation\n[19] She's Lost Control\n\n\tDisc 04 Play Time 01h:16m:43s\n\nTotal FLAC Play Time\t&gt; 05h:08m:08s\nTotal File Size\t&gt; 1.09GBs (Including FLAC, Art Covers &amp; File)\nMusic File Type\t&gt; Exact Audio Copy ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Level 8\nMusic Video Format\t&gt; N / A\nScanned Artwork\t&gt; Yes @ 300dpi &amp; 200dpi\nOriginal CD Rip\t&gt; Yes - only1joe\nOriginal Uploader\t&gt; Yes - only1joe \nUpload Speed\t&gt; 33-35KB/s\nMusic Genre\t&gt; Alternative Punk Pop\nRelease Date\t&gt; December 1997\nRecord Company\t&gt; London Records\nArtists WebSite\t&gt; \n\n? http://joydivision.homestead.com\n&gt; http://www.joydiv.org\n&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joy_Division\n&gt; http://oldielyrics.com/j/joy_division.html\n\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n* * * I Will Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents * * *\n* * * This Is A Multi-Tracker Torrent Check Your Bit Torrent Client For A True Number Of Seeds * * *\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:141d9ad013e79cbb36024d77d78a5845287518b3","amp;dn":"%5B1997%5D+Heart+And+Soul+-+Joy+Division+1.99GBs+FLAC+%5Bonly1joe%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"141d9ad013e79cbb36024d77d78a5845287518b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,29,154,208,19,231,156,187,54,2,77,119,215,138,88,69,40,117,24,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
