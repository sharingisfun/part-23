With unfettered access to the records, David Horner tells the real story of Australia's domestic intelligence organisation, from shaky beginnings to the expulsion of Ivan Skripov in 1963.\n\nFrom the start, ASIO's mission was to catch spies. In the late 1940s, the top secret Venona program revealed details of a Soviet spy ring in Australia, supported by leading Australian communists. David Horner outlines the tactics ASIO used in counterespionage, from embassy bugging to surveillance of local suspects. His research sheds new light on the Petrov Affair, and details incidents and activities that have never been revealed before","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d5e27528782e1e117fdf775aa1ddb8b85ef367a","amp;dn":"The+Spy+Catchers%3A+The+Official+History+of+ASIO+1949+-+1963","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d5e27528782e1e117fdf775aa1ddb8b85ef367a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,94,39,82,135,130,225,225,23,253,247,117,170,29,219,139,133,239,54,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
