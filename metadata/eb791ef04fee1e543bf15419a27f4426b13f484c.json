The emotive singer born May 26, 1939, in Selma, AL, was raised in Columbus, GA. He sung gospel in church and high school with a group he called the Sensational Melodies of Joy. After high school he ventured into secular music with the Searchers waxing &quot;Wow Wow Baby&quot; b/w &quot;Ooo-Wee&quot; on Class Records in 1958. They kept searching doing local and regional gigs and in 1961 cut a final recording, &quot;Yvonne&quot; b/w &quot;Little Wanda,&quot; on Max Records. Like the first, the public and radio stations ignored it and the Searchers disbanded. Three years later Toney soloed with &quot;Can It All Be Love,&quot; produced by Bobby Smith in Macon, GA, but released on Cincinnati's King Records; it too went unnoticed. \n\n\nFormat:\t\tMp3\nBitrate:\t\t320 \nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n01.He Don't Love You (And He'll Break Your Heart)\n02.Dark End Of The Street\n03.Down In Texas\n04.Moon River\n05.Ain't That True Love\n06.Do Right Woman-Do Right Man\n07.For Your Precious Love\n08.Turn On Your Love Light\n09.Any Day Now\n10.That's All I Want From You\n11.No Sad Songs\n\nSupport The Artists.\nBuy it if you like it!\n\nThanks for Seeding\nCheers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb791ef04fee1e543bf15419a27f4426b13f484c","amp;dn":"Oscar+Toney%2C+Jr.+-+For+Your+Precious+Love+%28Reissue%29+%282006%29+%5B320%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb791ef04fee1e543bf15419a27f4426b13f484c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,121,30,240,79,238,30,84,59,241,84,25,162,127,68,38,177,63,72,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
