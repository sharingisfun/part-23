Joined by friends (including Woody Guthrie) on backing vocals and harmonica, Leadbelly's resonant 12-string guitar and warm, enthusiastic singing charge through numbers like &quot;There's A Man Going Round Taking Names&quot; and &quot;Corn Bread Rough.&quot;\n\nThe greatest delight of the album is the unhindered spirit of freedom and improvisation that pervades: gradually quickening tempos, shouts and hollers, minor flubs, and extemporaneous lyrics-- such as the duet with Woody Guthrie on &quot;We Shall Be Free&quot; and the chop-licking explication of all the pancakes available in heaven in &quot;Good, Good, Good.&quot; Moreover, it is easy to see how these songs became and have remained so popular \n\n\nTracklist\n1.
