Nowadays, as art is more and more integrated with architectural design, the faÃƒÂ§ade of a building is no longer of the previous unified pattern. Recently a visible renaissance is taking place where intelligent, provocative and series color is being used to serve form and function and take a leading role in architectural environments. All projects featured in this book were completed between 2004 to 2008 clearly illustrating this resurgence over a very short period of time. We have, for now, put aside our chromophobia, replacing the archromic facades of the last several decades with polychromatic celebration of a new technology. What is most intriguing about this collection of projects is the diversity of materials and application. Colour has become wholly integrated into the construction process with a vast array of techniques. Rather than a secondary afterthought, chromaticity is considered through materials, surface, light and finish at an early stage in the design process. Regardless of whether one or many colors are used on a buildingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s faÃƒÂ§ade, color becomes the most significant and noticeable thing about the building.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ffa377bf6269af408271d7f9cb486c9476057427","amp;dn":"Color+in+architecture+facade+%28Architecture+Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ffa377bf6269af408271d7f9cb486c9476057427","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,163,119,191,98,105,175,64,130,113,215,249,203,72,108,148,118,5,116,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
