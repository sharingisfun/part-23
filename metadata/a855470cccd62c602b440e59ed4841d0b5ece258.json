Among the finest examples of early Renaissance painting are Masaccio's Saint Andrew and Gentile da Fabriano's richly painted Coronation of the Virgin. Typical of the High Renaissance are Andrea Mantegna's splendid Adoration of the Magi and the newly acquired Rest on the Flight into Egypt by Fra Bartolommeo. The art of the Netherlands in its Golden Age is represented by Jan Breughel's much-loved painting The Entry of the Animals into Noah's Ark, as well as by Rembrandt's Abduction of Europa and Jan Steen's Drawing Lesson, while the modern age is exemplified by the Irises of Vincent van Gogh. Painting in France ranges from Georges de La Tour's enigmatic Beggars' Brawl and Poussin's classical Holy Family, through the Impressionism of Renoir and Monet, to Cezanne's post-impressionist Still Life with Apples","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a855470cccd62c602b440e59ed4841d0b5ece258","amp;dn":"Masterpieces+of+the+Getty+Museum-Paintings+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a855470cccd62c602b440e59ed4841d0b5ece258","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,85,71,12,204,214,44,96,43,68,14,89,237,72,65,208,181,236,226,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
