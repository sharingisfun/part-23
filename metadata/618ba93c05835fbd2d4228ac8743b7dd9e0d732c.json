As a young academic, teaching philosophy at Oxford, Murdoch meets and eventually falls in love with fellow professor John Bayley, a man whose awkwardness seems in stark opposition to the spirited self-confidence of his future wife. The story unfolds as snippets of time, seen through Bayley&amp;#039;s eyes. He recalls their first encounter over 40 years ago, activities they enjoyed doing together, and Iris&amp;#039; charismatic and individualistic personality. These images portray Murdoch as a vibrant young woman with great intellect and \nare contrasted with the novelist&amp;#039;s later life, after the effects of Alzheimer&amp;#039;s disease have ravaged her. Murdoch&amp;#039;s great mind deteriorates until she is reduced to a mere vestige of her former self, unable to perform simple tasks and completely reliant on her at times frustrated yet devoted husband. \n\nInfo: \n\nVideo:720x400 \nFrames:25.000/s \nLen:1:27:03 \nFrms:130,55 \nkbps:894 \nQf:0.124 \n\nAudio: \n0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3 \n48000Hz 384 kb/s tot,6 chnls(3/2.1) \n\nFile Length Correct \nAVI v1.0 \nInterleave: 1 vid frame (40 ms), preload=32 \nAudio frames: Aligned on interleaves \nVideo: 556 MB (69.37%) \nAudio: 239 MB (29.79%) \nAVI Overhead: 6.73 MB (0.84%) \n\n[JUNK]odmldmlh \n[ISFT]Lavf51.19.0 \n[USER]XviD0046 \n\nEnjoy....","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:618ba93c05835fbd2d4228ac8743b7dd9e0d732c","amp;dn":"Iris-AC3-5.1-DVDRip%5BEng%5D2001.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"618ba93c05835fbd2d4228ac8743b7dd9e0d732c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,139,169,60,5,131,95,189,45,66,40,172,135,67,183,221,158,13,115,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
