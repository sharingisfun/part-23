Readers will learn step-by-step how to program the HCS12 using both assembly and C languages, as well as how to use such development tools as CodeWarrior, ImageCraft ICC12, MiniIDE, GNU C, and EGNU IDE. Supportive examples clearly illustrate all applications of the HCS12 peripheral functions, including parallel port, timer functions, PWM, UART port, SPI, I2C, CAN, on-chip flash and EEPROM programming, external memory expansion, and more. New sections on C programming style, software development methodology, and software reuse have been added in theis revision. A back-of-book CD contains the source code for all examples in the book, several groups of reusable utility functions, and complimentary freeware development tools for improved learning.\n\n\n   I found this torrent online somewhere hard to find and decided to try and make googling for it easier by uploading it here to this popular site.  It has all bookmarks and optimization done already.  Study hard and God Bless !","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:53a869495fbc2ba79622382f1bacefe8289f8464","amp;dn":"The+HCS12+-+9S12+-+An+Introduction+to+Software+and+Hardware+Inte","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"53a869495fbc2ba79622382f1bacefe8289f8464","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,168,105,73,95,188,43,167,150,34,56,47,27,172,239,232,40,159,132,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
