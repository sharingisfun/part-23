A wickedly brilliant tale of revenge, mystery, and fate, Antony MooreÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s The Swap is at once a gripping thriller and a hilarious black comedyÃ¢â‚¬â€a book for anyone whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ever wondered what could have been. . . .\n\nHarvey BriscowÃ¢â‚¬â€smoker, drinker, comic-shop ownerÃ¢â‚¬â€is facing another school reunion back in Cornwall. Having spent the last two decades second-guessing himself, Harvey isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t thrilled at the prospect of showing his classmates the mess heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s made of his life. But this is HarveyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s twentieth reunion, a milestone that all but guarantees that Charles Ã¢â‚¬Å“BleederÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ OddÃ¢â‚¬â€the freakish reject who made off with HarveyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s now-priceless Superman One comic in a school-yard swapÃ¢â‚¬â€will be in attendance.\n\nBut when Harvey returns to Cornwall, hoping to retrieve his comic, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s met with more than a few surprises. . . .
