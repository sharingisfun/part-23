It starts with a dynamic, never-before published Kirby FF wraparound cover (and wait'll you see the flip side)! Also, we present a dual interview between classic FFÃ¢â‚¬Ë†inkers JOEÃ¢â‚¬Ë†SINNOTTÃ¢â‚¬Ë†and DICKÃ¢â‚¬Ë†AYERS! Then, there's a rare Lee and Ã¢â‚¬Ë†Kirby interview, and we compare one of Jack and Stan's FF Bullpen story conferences to what ended up on Stan's final script and Jack's penciled pages. Plus there's MARKÃ¢â‚¬Ë†EVANIER and our other regular columnists, and galleries of Kirby FF art, including pencils from Kirby's BLACKÃ¢â‚¬Ë†PANTHER, SILVERÃ¢â‚¬Ë†SURFER, and more!
