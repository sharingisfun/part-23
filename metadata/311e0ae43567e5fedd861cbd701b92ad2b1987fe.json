Regardless of talent, quality, and financial backing, Mowest faced an uphill battle. With the majority of Motown's focus on the already established names of Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye, Diana Ross, Smokey Robinson, The Temptations, and their latest chart dynamos, The Jackson 5, there wasn't as much attention being given to the diverse Mowest roster. Acts like Syreeta, Sisters Love, and G.C. Cameron seemed to get lost in the shuffle. Though the label released over 40 singles and close to a dozen albums from up and comers like Odyssey to established veterans Frankie Valli &amp; The Four Seasons, the expected hits never materialized and the imprint quietly folded in 1973. While Mowest artists The Commodores, Thelma Houston, and the aforementioned Cameron continued on with Motown proper, the sub label's catalog quickly gathered dust in the cut-out bins of record stores throughout the States.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:311e0ae43567e5fedd861cbd701b92ad2b1987fe","amp;dn":"VA+-+Motown%27s+Mowest+Story+1971-73+%28MP3%40320%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"311e0ae43567e5fedd861cbd701b92ad2b1987fe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,30,10,228,53,103,229,254,221,134,28,189,112,27,146,173,43,25,135,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
