While there are still a handful of metallic rockers, III is built on a folky, acoustic foundation that gives the music extra depth. And even the rockers aren't as straightforward as before: the galloping &quot;Immigrant Song&quot; is powered by Robert Plant's banshee wail, &quot;Celebration Day&quot; turns blues-rock inside out with a warped slide guitar riff, and &quot;Out on the Tiles&quot; lumbers along with a tricky, multi-part riff. Nevertheless, the heart of the album lies on the second side, when the band delve deeply into English folk. &quot;Gallows Pole&quot; updates a traditional tune with a menacing flair, and &quot;Bron-Y-Aur Stomp&quot; is an infectious acoustic romp, while &quot;That's the Way&quot; and &quot;Tangerine&quot; are shimmering songs with graceful country flourishes. The band hasn't left the blues behind, but the twisted bottleneck blues of &quot;Hats off to (Roy) Harper&quot; actually outstrips the epic &quot;Since I've Been Loving You,&quot; which is the only time Zeppelin sound a bit set in their ways.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:294732cc6fd9502817545f60c37677b113282302","amp;dn":"Led+Zeppelin+III+24+Bit+Vinyl+Pack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"294732cc6fd9502817545f60c37677b113282302","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,71,50,204,111,217,80,40,23,84,95,96,195,118,119,177,19,40,35,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
