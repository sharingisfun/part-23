While trying to solve one of FloridaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most profound secrets, Doc Ford is the target of a murder attempt by someone who wants to make it look like an accident. Or is the target actually Tomlinson? Whatever the answer, the liveaboards and fishing guides at DinkinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Bay on Sanibel Island are becoming increasingly nervousÃ¢â‚¬â€and waryÃ¢â‚¬â€after a near-poisoning, a plane crash, and an explosion make it apparent that Ford and Tomlinson are dangerous companions.

There is an assassin on the loose, and it is up to them to find the killerÃ¢â‚¬â€before he (or she) finishes the job.\nUnabridged.\nRead by George Guidall.\n\n------------------------------\nVisit us for this and more, book requests can also be made through the site:\n\nwww.audiobookvault.ws\n------------------------------\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa681c25eb0bd8a7594e075b12e8488617be0582","amp;dn":"Night+Moves+-+Randy+Wayne+White","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa681c25eb0bd8a7594e075b12e8488617be0582","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,104,28,37,235,11,216,167,89,78,7,91,18,232,72,134,23,190,5,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
