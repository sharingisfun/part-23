Which is fortunate, because an army of dead soldiers has risen from Arlington Cemetery, armed with an arsenal of otherworldly weapons! All this, and F.B.I. Agent Jeff Terrell (formerly known as Shaft) is one step closer to solving a series of murder that threaten to shake Youngblood to its core! \n\nYoungblood #73\nWhen an international role playing internet game becomes a conduit to world wide evil, it is up to Youngblood to pull the plug. Unfortunately, Lady Photon's solution might be enough to endanger the team's continued existence! While Jeff gets closer to solving the case of a time-hopping serial killer, something is alive inside of the critically injured Badrock - something that wants out!\n\nYoungblood #74\nThey say that what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas... but when what happens is a pan-dimensional alien who wins all of Sin CIty in a bet, then it is up to Youngblood to go all in. It's double or nothing for Shaft, Die Hard, Lady Phantom, Vogue and Cougar, with the fate of several million people hanging in the balance. (No pressure!) Also, FBI Agent Jeff Terrell is one step closer to solving the mystery of a serial killer who moves through time. All this takes place on the eve of the 75th issue of YOUNGBLOOD!\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7768608/Youngblood_v1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7768608/Youngblood_v1&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7796632/Youngblood_v2__1-10__14&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7796632/Youngblood_v2__1-10__14&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7796648/Youngblood_v3&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7796648/Youngblood_v3&lt;/a&gt;\n\nYoungblood (2012) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7297144/Youngblood_071_(2012)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7297144/Youngblood_071_(2012)&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da64a538c09b57642bccc72c31b68fc91d496761","amp;dn":"Youngblood+%2372-74+%282012%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da64a538c09b57642bccc72c31b68fc91d496761","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,100,165,56,192,155,87,100,43,204,199,44,49,182,143,201,29,73,103,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
