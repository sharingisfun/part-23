Implicit is the notion that there also exists\npotentially, that which we call ugly - and everything in between - so nothing is\njust &quot;equal&quot; in fact!\n\nIs specific beauty simply in the eye of the beholder even if we accept that it\nexists in something potentially. Is a violin to be crafted in such a way as that\nit responds completely to esoteric acoustic tests as it were. Or should the shape\nand &quot;finish&quot; also count for some of its appeal - (if it performs its function &quot;well enough&quot; that is) Should it show no character of any sort in what is a\n&quot;perfect&quot; shaping, or could it have a bit of personality too from its wood \ngrains, and if so, is &quot;tasteful conservative&quot; a nice enough level of such ideas\nof perfection. Who is to say?\n\nAnd if beauty as this is to exist, how does it come about? Who is capable\nof creating it, and what guides their sensibilities and creativity and abilities\nto nurture what it sis they create, and hone thir own talents in this respect.\nWho is best to patronize them appropriately so as to encourage their spirit in\nadequate fashion. Then we are to consider, who is to be bestowed with the\nbeautiful of our creations. How is it that they are to merit being stewards and\nowners in some respect of what is the product of mankinds best treasures. \nSpeaking of which, would you say a &quot;piece&quot; of music making instrument is \ncomparable in what it gives to what is the beauty that is the stuff of a \n&quot;beautiful woman&quot;. If so can we ask the very same questions here. \n\nSome believe that simply having something to analyse, gives it somehow,\na beauty enough! What a shallow mindset hat is in fact in matters of human\nconsiderations overall, I put it to you!\n\n\nWe really do have have to ask: who can best appreciate what is of beauty \nin our midst? How are they to rightly care for such of our collective treasures? \nHow do they come to deserve to have our treasures. Do they have the right\nsensibilities to appreciate what it is that these treasures are? Do they \nhave the right sensibilties to judge the worth and merit of our treasures,\nas indicated in the preceeding. \n\nThe truth is that real beauty does not come from a mind made as a blunt \ninstrument around human beings of true sensible worthiness. You have to have the\ncapacity to relate in our midst and care for what is beautiful - because it \nmust be part of who you are. Otherwise you will mainly have envy and want to\nsteal, while being mainly incomptent at the business of relating politely to\nthose that are the producers and merited true owners of the treasures I speak of.\n\nSo if you are to produce Western music, it must come from a mind that knows\nwhat is in fact Western sensible. Not from a mind that sees Western as alien,\nforeign and best banished into the fires of &quot;rejection oriented mindsets&quot; in\nthis regard, whether for reasons of bigotry based on so called &quot;religious&quot; or\nsimilar political considerations or simply from a lack of knowedge of what is\nin fact  beautiful to the human mind.\n\nIf you are to care for a violin that makes such music - you must be someone that\nlives with appreciation for the greatest western music within you, (although\nnot all music made for violin is &quot;equal&quot; - I love baroque personally especially\nVivaldi and some of Bach most certainly too) as without this fact, you have \nnothing more than an object for trade - and likely without any real regard for\nits rightful place amongst those that better deserve it for their appreciation\nof what it is that you have there somehow in you possession - gotten by ill gained\nmethods such as having been purloined, in fact!\n\nAnd if somene has something beautiful that you desire, shold you knowingly\ndiscount or negate its true worth or engage in similar such tactics - until\nsuch time as you are able to possess it for yourself? If so, it may be \nsubjectively speaking &quot;worthless&quot;  by the time it becomes yours - simply because\nof the tactics you employ in its pursuit. Some negotiate for all things in life\nthis way.\n\n\nNothing of beauty retains this quality outside of being placed where\nit can be rightly appreciated, rightly made use of, and rightly given\nit nurture and care. It is otherwise simply misbegotten gains by a seeming\n(Shakespearan) &quot;Merchant of Venice&quot; intent only on exploitation for an &quot;extra\npound of flesh&quot; at best, before it can be restored to a more deserving owner\n(as it were).\n\n\nWhat is Western music after all (in the best traditins that is) than a reminder of the idealism that we once stood for and therefore simply a means of reinforcing our sense of commitment and loyalty to who it is we are, as hat is what our music reminds us of, and makes us cognizant of - in what is our raison detre. \nOutside of this it remains nothing but a curioisity for those &quot;that will never make the grade&quot; as they lack the means to do so perhaps - if they lack the minds\nwith which to completely embrace in truth and reality - that which we are -\nof our best as a peoples wthin this great society that has formed the beauty on this earth. Music after all is not just sounds that are made to register\non a scale of somesort to give some kind of inane pleasure that sounds\ncan be forced from an instrument in some or other level of volume. It must have\ntrue are leal menaing in making you fell a part f something great. And this you\nmust already belong to, based on how you are made in sensible fashion to \nappreciate truly the context of its creative intent.\n\n\nMichael Rizzo Chessman\n\nNote:\n\nWe aim for practical application of all our avi movie files so that they are\nable to play on your computer - which can hook up to your TV, or used on a\nan HD capable DivX disc player without having to pay for expensive blank discs\nto do your burn with.
