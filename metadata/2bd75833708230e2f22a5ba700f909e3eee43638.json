It portrays the career of Benedict Arnold in the American Revolutionary War and his dramatic switch in 1780 from fighting for American Independence to being a Loyalist trying to preserve British rule in America. Arnold's relationships with his wife Peggy Shippen and the British officer John Andre are focused on.\n\n\nAidan Quinn - Benedict Arnold\nKelsey Grammer - George Washington\nFlora Montgomery - Peggy Shippen\nJohn Light - John Andre\nNick Dunning - Henry Clinton\nStephen Hogan - Joseph Reed\n\n\nBenedict Arnold V (January 14, 1741 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ June 14, 1801) was a general during the American Revolutionary War. He began the war in the Continental Army but later defected to the British Army. While a general on the American side, he obtained command of the fort at West Point, New York, and plotted to surrender it to the British forces. After the plot was exposed in September 1780, he was commissioned into the British Army as a brigadier general.\n\nBorn in Connecticut, Arnold was merchant operating ships on the Atlantic Ocean when the war broke out in 1775. After joining the growing army outside Boston, he distinguished himself through acts of cunning and bravery. His actions included the Capture of Fort Ticonderoga in 1775, defensive and delaying tactics despite losing the Battle of Valcour Island on Lake Champlain in 1776, the Battle of Ridgefield, Connecticut (after which he was promoted to major general), operations in relief of the Siege of Fort Stanwix, and key actions during the pivotal Battles of Saratoga in 1777, in which he suffered leg injuries that ended his combat career for several years.\n\nDespite Arnold's successes, he was passed over for promotion by the Continental Congress while other officers claimed credit for some of his accomplishments.[3] Adversaries in military and political circles brought charges of corruption or other malfeasance, but most often he was acquitted in formal inquires. Congress investigated his accounts and found he was indebted to Congress after spending much of his own money on the war effort. Frustrated and bitter, Arnold decided to change sides in 1779, and opened secret negotiations with the British. In July 1780, he sought and obtained command of West Point in order to surrender it to the British. Arnold's scheme was exposed when American forces captured British Major John AndrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© carrying papers that revealed the plot. Upon learning of AndrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©'s capture, Arnold fled down the Hudson River to the British sloop-of-war Vulture, narrowly avoiding capture by the forces of George Washington, who had been alerted to the plot.\n\nArnold received a commission as a brigadier general in the British Army, an annual pension of Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£360, and a lump sum of over Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£6,000.[4] He led British forces on raids in Virginia, and against New London and Groton, Connecticut, before the war effectively ended with the American victory at Yorktown. In the winter of 1782, Arnold moved to London with his second wife, Margaret &quot;Peggy&quot; Shippen Arnold. He was well received by King George III and the Tories but frowned upon by the Whigs. In 1787, he entered into mercantile business with his sons Richard and Henry in Saint John, New Brunswick, but returned to London to settle permanently in 1791, where he died ten years later.\n\nBecause of the way he changed sides, his name quickly became a byword in the United States for treason or betrayal. His conflicting legacy is recalled in the ambiguous nature of some of the memorials that have been placed in his honor.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2bd75833708230e2f22a5ba700f909e3eee43638","amp;dn":"Benedict+Arnold+-+A+Question+of+Honor+%282003%29+Aidan+Quinn%2C+Kelsey","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2bd75833708230e2f22a5ba700f909e3eee43638","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,215,88,51,112,130,48,226,242,42,91,167,0,249,9,227,238,228,54,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
