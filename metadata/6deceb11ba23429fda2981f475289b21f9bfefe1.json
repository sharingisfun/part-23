Three heroes - intrepid, curious and idiotic -- join forces to reach the centre of an alien world. Their fate rests in their ability to conquer the deadly secrets that await them.\n\nThe art is beautiful and this comic is something different from the norm. Seems to be an independent translation as only Book one seems to be available in English elsewhere and has a slightly different translation.\n\n\n*** Enjoy and Please SEED ***\n\n\nThere are way too many great uploaders to list anymore :) Search TPB Comics and you'll find almost anything you want.
