It is described in similar or perhaps the same terms as Dr. Jeffrey Thompson has been describing his discovery of Epsilon, the brainwave state below 0.5 Hz over the years. It seems extraordinary that different groups of EEG researchers, independent of one another, should find the same states of consciousness associated with such divergent brainwave activity - below 0.5 Hz Delta to above 100 Hz HyperGamma to 200 Hz Lambda.\n\nDr. Jeffrey Thompson speaks to a circular link between these two extremes of brainwave activity and the states of consciousness which they represent. They appear to be associated with the type of extraordinary states of consciousness we find in the highest states of meditation, deepest levels of insight, personal original creative problem solving and high degrees of personal awareness. Dr. Thompson has surmised that these extremely fast Lambda brainwave patterns modulating are &quot;riding&quot; on super slow Epsilon waves.\n\nThis brain state was named Ã¢â‚¬Å“LambdaÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ by Dr. Jeffrey Thompson and his students. It has been appreciated by Dr. ThompsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s patients since the late 1990Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s and by the public since 200l. It is best used when in a meditative posture. It has a wonderful ability to deepen and enrich oneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s meditation and prayer.\n\n60 min\n\nreference libFLAC 1.3.1 20141125\n\nSecure rip and AccurateRip verified.
