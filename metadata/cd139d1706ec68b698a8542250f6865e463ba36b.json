But, for Detective Sergeant Wesley Peterson, it's like coming home. Not only was he at university in the area, one of the first people he bumps into is an old friend.

But DC Steve Carstairs has &quot;pillock&quot; written all over him; there'll be no problem dealing with him. And, there's no time for trouble to brew, as Wes is immediately involved in a major search for a missing child.
