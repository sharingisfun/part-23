Brahms's fourth and final symphony feels like the composer's supreme achievement for orchestra; its finale, a radiant passacaglia, is the summation of the composer's quest to wed discipline and emotion. After Walton's boisterous Partita comes the world premiere of the latest Proms cello concerto, a piece written by Huw Watkins and played by his brother, Paul. It's a work that stems from the brothers' long experience of performing chamber music together. &quot;I'm biased of course,&quot; says Huw, &quot;but there's no cellist I know who makes a more expressive and beautiful sound.&quot;\r\n\r\nProms Extra: An Introduction to Brahms's Fourth Symphony\r\n\r\nMartin Handley, with musicologists Laura Tunbridge and Robert Samuels, provide an introduction to Brahms's Symphony No 4 in E minor, the composer's last symphony, notable for its last movement which is in the form of a symphonic passacaglia.\r\n\r\nMedia Info:-\r\n\r\nGeneral\r\nFormat : MPEG Audio\r\nOverall bit rate mode : Constant\r\nOverall bit rate : 320 Kbps\r\nAlbum : BBC Proms: 2016\r\nTrack name : Symphony No.4 in E minor\r\nTrack name/Position : 0\r\nPerformer : Brahms\r\nGenre : Music\r\nWriting library : LAME3.98r\r\n\r\n\r\nAudio\r\nFormat : MPEG Audio\r\nFormat version : Version 1\r\nFormat profile : Layer 3\r\nMode : Joint stereo\r\nBit rate mode : Constant\r\nBit rate : 320 Kbps\r\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\r\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\r\nCompression mode : Lossy\r\nWriting library : LAME3.98r\r\nEncoding settings : -m j -V 4 -q 3 -lowpass 20.5","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c1b913b74db727141a394c6ba8cc3651cc01f910","amp;dn":"BBC+Proms+2016%2C+Prom+37+-+Walton%2C+Watkins%2C+Webern%2C+Brahms","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c1b913b74db727141a394c6ba8cc3651cc01f910","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,185,19,183,77,183,39,20,26,57,76,107,168,204,54,81,204,1,249,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
