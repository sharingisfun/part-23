Learn how NewtonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s formulations help us predict planetary positions, launch spacecraft, and find the masses of everything from the Earth to distant galaxies.\n    * Discover why energy in the Universe is transmitted mostly by radiation, which warms the day, cools the night, and allows us to see the stars.\n    * Understand physical astronomy: the science in which we reach out to learn the real natures of the planets.\n    * Ponder Earth as the paradigm for all the other inner planets.\n    * Voyage to the two giant planets of the Solar System, Jupiter and Saturn.\n    * Explore Uranus and NeptuneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½close twins with the distinct exception of their axial tilts.\n    * Investigate the Solar SystemÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s leftovers of planetary formation -- comets and asteroids.\n    * Understand how the accumulated data on the Solar System provides profound information on how the planets were created from the dust of outer space.\n\nCourse Syllabus:\n\nIntroductory Remarks\n\nLecture I We and the Universe\n\nLecture II Reflections of the Spinning Earth\n\nLecture III Sun and Seasons\n\nLecture IV Stories in the Sky: Constellations\n\nLecture V Romance of the Moon\n\nLecture VI Happy Wanderers: The Planets\n\nLecture VII Keeping It All Together\n\nLecture VIII Reaching Outward\n\nLecture IX Our Domain: Earth and the Moon\n\nLecture X Iron Planets: Mercury, Venus, and Mars\n\nLecture XI Monsters of the Midway: Jupiter and Saturn\n\nLecture XII Distant Outposts: Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto\n\nLecture XIII Leftovers of Creation: Comets, Asteroids, and Meteors\n\nLecture XIV Creation\n\nCourse Materials\n\nRelated links: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/cosmic/cosmic.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/cosmic/cosmic.html&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.nineplanets.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.nineplanets.org/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://hea-www.harvard.edu/ECT/the_book/Chap1/Chapter1.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://hea-www.harvard.edu/ECT/the_book/Chap1/Chapter1.html&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.onr.navy.mil/focus/spacesciences/observingsky/motion1.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.onr.navy.mil/focus/spacesciences/observingsky/motion1.htm&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.celestialnavigation.net/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.celestialnavigation.net/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://aa.usno.navy.mil/data/docs/RS_OneDay.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://aa.usno.navy.mil/data/docs/RS_OneDay.php&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr161/lect/time/seasons.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr161/lect/time/seasons.html&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.astro.uiuc.edu/projects/data/Seasons/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.astro.uiuc.edu/projects/data/Seasons/index.html&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e11693b3ba39771ef4a348f41fcdb2353700d1e4","amp;dn":"TMS+Astronomy+-+Earth%2C+Sky%2C+and+Planets","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e11693b3ba39771ef4a348f41fcdb2353700d1e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,22,147,179,186,57,119,30,244,163,72,244,31,205,178,53,55,0,209,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
