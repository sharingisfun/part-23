Over the course of the book he regained his memory with the help of a Canadian economist, Marie, and later found that he was previously an operative of the Central Intelligence Agency in an elite project in Southeast Asia and Vietnam codenamed Medusa...\n\nAt the beginning of The Bourne Supremacy, Bourne has recovered from most mental and all physical injuries and is teaching Asian studies at a university in Maine under his real name of David Webb. He is also living happily on campus with Marie and is getting regular psychological tests from his doctor...\n\n - - - - - - - - \n\nFrom back cover:\n\nA KILLER WITH NO FACE, NO IDENTITY, AND A NAME THE WORLD WANTED TO FORGET: JASON BOURNE\n\nReenter the shadowy world of Jason Bourne, an expert assassin still plagued by the splintered nightmares of his former life. This time the stakes are higher than ever. For someone else has taken on the Bourne identityÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½a ruthless killer who must be stopped or the world will pay a devastating price. To succeed, the real Jason Bourne must maneuver through the dangerous labyrinth of international espionageÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½an exotic world filled with CIA plots, turncoat agents, and ever-shifting alliancesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½all the while hoping to find the truth behind his haunted memories and the answers to his own fragmented past. This time there are two BournesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and one must die.\n\n\n&quot;A killer of a thriller.&quot; --USA Today\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:328d3935336688628a8a455c22295e73e82f1da0","amp;dn":"THE+BOURNE+SUPREMACY+-+Robert+Ludlum.+Read+Scott+Brick+%7BFerraBit","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"328d3935336688628a8a455c22295e73e82f1da0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,141,57,53,51,102,136,98,138,138,69,92,34,41,94,115,232,47,29,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
