These divergent influences come together splendidly in Bon AppÃ©tit, Y'all, a modern Southern chef's passionate and utterly appealing homage to her culinary roots. Espousing a simple-is-best philosophy, Virginia uses the finest ingredients, concentrates on sound French technique, and lets the food shine in a style she calls &quot;refined Southern cuisine.&quot; More than 200 approachable and consistently delicious recipes are arranged by chapter into starters and nibbles; salads and slaws; eggs and dairy; meat, fowl, and fish main dishes; sides; biscuits and breads; soups and stews; desserts; and sauces and preserves. Collected here are stylishly updated Southern and French classics (New SouthernChicken and Dumplings, Boeuf Bourgignonne), rib-sticking, old-timey favorites (Meme's Fried Okra, Angel Biscuits), and perfectly executed comfort food (Mama's Apple Pie, Fried Catfish Fingers with Country RÃ©moulade). Nearly 100 photographs bring to life both Virginia's food and the bounty of her native Georgia. You'll also find a wealth of tips and techniques from a skilled and innovative teacher, and the stories of a Southern girl steeped to her core in the food, kitchen lore, and unconditional hospitality of her culinary forebears on both sides of the Atlantic. Bon AppÃ©tit, Y'all is Virginia's way of saying, &quot;Welcome to my Southern kitchen. Pull up a chair.&quot; Once you have tasted her food, you'll want to stay a good long while","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6671ed8d967e39399c42053dcc3495c358e1560f","amp;dn":"Bon+Appetit%2C+Y%27all+-+Recipes+and+Stories+from+Three+Generations+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6671ed8d967e39399c42053dcc3495c358e1560f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,113,237,141,150,126,57,57,156,66,5,61,204,52,149,195,88,225,86,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
