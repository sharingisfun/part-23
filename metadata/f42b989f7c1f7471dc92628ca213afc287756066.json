Is This Bottle Corked? is something different: a book that posesÃ¢â‚¬â€œand answersÃ¢â‚¬â€œthe really important questions about wine.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ What was Falstaff drinking when he called for more sack? \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ What was actually drunk at PlatoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Symposium? \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ When is rot &quot;noble&quot;?\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Who was the first American connoisseur of wineÃ¢â‚¬â€œit wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t George Washington, but speaking of the general, what was his favorite wine? \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Why on earth do wine connoisseurs talk like that? \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Was Pliny the Elder the first Robert Parker? \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Why do we drink to forgetÃ¢â‚¬â€œand why doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t it work?\n\nThese and many other intriguing, amusing, and curious questions are answered within, guaranteeing the reader a &quot;Yes, but did you know . . .?&quot; for every occasion at which a cork is drawn.\n\nBest read with a glass of aged German riesling, or perhaps a soft, consoling Constantia (recommended by Jane Austen for heartbreak and, to boot, gout) or maybe even a glass of St. AnneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Rhubarb and Ginger Wine, this book is as much for bon vivants and those of us who just enjoy a good bottle or two as for the committed oenophile.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/mfxfYB8.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/mfxfYB8.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f42b989f7c1f7471dc92628ca213afc287756066","amp;dn":"Is+This+Bottle+Corked%3F%3A+The+Secret+Life+of+Wine","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f42b989f7c1f7471dc92628ca213afc287756066","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,43,152,159,124,31,116,113,220,146,98,140,162,19,175,194,135,117,96,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
