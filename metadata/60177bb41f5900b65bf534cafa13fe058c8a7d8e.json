Since the release of their self-titled debut album in 1972, the band has sold over 24 million albums worldwide, including 7 million in the United States alone.[citation needed] The band's music videos, especially &quot;Burnin' for You&quot;, received heavy rotation on MTV when the music television network premiered in 1981, cementing the band's contribution to the development and success of the music video in modern pop culture. Today, BÃƒâ€“C's music continues to be played on AOR-friendly radio stations as well as in movies, television shows, and commercials, and even during sporting events.\n\nBlue Ãƒâ€“yster Cult's current lineup includes long-time members Donald &quot;Buck Dharma&quot; Roeser (lead guitar, vocals) and Eric Bloom (lead vocals, rhythm guitar, keyboard), as well as Jules Radino (drums, percussion), Richie Castellano (keyboard, guitar, vocals), and Kasim Sulton (bass guitar).\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nExtraterrestrial Live is the American hard rock band Blue Ãƒâ€“yster Cult's third live album, released in 1982. It documents their 1981 tour in support of Fire of Unknown Origin, but includes two tracks recorded in 1980, during the Black and Blue tour with Black Sabbath. Midway through the tour of 1981, the band fired drummer and founding member Albert Bouchard, replacing him with roadie Rick Downey. This was the band's third live album in less than a decade. The solo on &quot;Veteran of the Psychic Wars&quot; is widely regarded by fans and critics as one of Buck Dharma's best.\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:60177bb41f5900b65bf534cafa13fe058c8a7d8e","amp;dn":"B.O.C.+-+Extraterrestrial+Live+%5B1982%5D%5B2012%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"60177bb41f5900b65bf534cafa13fe058c8a7d8e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,23,123,180,31,89,0,182,91,245,52,202,250,19,254,5,140,138,125,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
