A practical and versatile reference source, now in its fourth edition, the layout has been changed and the book has been streamlined to ensure the information is even more quickly and readily available - making it a handy companion on-site, in the office as well as for academic study. It also acts as a practical revision guide for those undertaking BTEC Nationals, Higher Nationals and NVQs, where engineering mathematics is an underpinning requirement of the course.\n\nAll the essentials of engineering mathematics - from algebra, geometry and trigonometry to logic circuits, differential equations and probability - are covered, with clear and succinct explanations and illustrated with over 300 line drawings and 500 worked examples based in real-world application. The emphasis throughout the book is on providing the practical tools needed to solve mathematical problems quickly and efficiently in engineering contexts. John BirdÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s presentation of this core material puts all the answers at your fingertips.\n\nEditorial Reviews\nAbout the Author\nJohn Bird, the author of over 100 textbooks on engineering and mathematical subjects, is the former Head of Applied Electronics in the Faculty of Technology at Highbury College, Portsmouth, U.K. More recently, he has combined freelance lecturing at Portsmouth University, with technical writing and Chief Examiner responsibilities for City and Guilds Telecommunication Principles and Mathematics, and examining for the International Baccalaureate Organisation.
