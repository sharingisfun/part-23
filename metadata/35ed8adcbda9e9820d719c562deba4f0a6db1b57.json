Their fortified camps were often overrun by the Viet Cong and, having no spare manpower, the US Special Forces created dedicated reaction units which could act in a responsive and flexible manner - Mobile Strike (MIKE) Forces.\n\nThis book examines the MIKE units, which were formed from the CIDG, the parachute and airmobile training they were given, and the operations that they undertook, from relieving friendly camps to large-scale independent offensive operations. Written by Gordon L. Rottman, a former US Special Forces soldier in Vietnam, this title provides the first organizational history of the MIKE forces in this conflict","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:35ed8adcbda9e9820d719c562deba4f0a6db1b57","amp;dn":"Mobile+Strike+Forces+in+Vietnam+1966-70","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"35ed8adcbda9e9820d719c562deba4f0a6db1b57","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,237,138,220,189,169,233,130,13,113,156,86,45,235,164,240,166,219,27,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
