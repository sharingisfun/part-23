Formed in 1997, Twiztid is composed of Jamie Spaniolo and Paul Methric, who perform under the respective personas of Jamie Madrox and Monoxide Child. Spaniolo and Methric are former members of the group House of Krazees, which disbanded in 1997. \n\n\nOver a decade removed from the original 4 The Fam EP, Twiztid returns with Volume 2 and they enlist a few Strange Music favorites for some brand new remixes.\n\nWith the demented-duo set to release their new Get Twiztid EP on April 15th, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve rewarded fans with 17 brand new and remixed tracks in the form of 4 The Fam Volume 2. Spanning TwiztidÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s career, the new (and did we mention FREE?) EP delivers mashups and mixes of fan-favorites along with a few unreleased gems.\n\nAmong the collection is the highly-anticipated remix to Ã¢â‚¬Å“Bad SideÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ featuring Strange MusicÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Rittz as well as SevenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s take on the classic Freek Show track, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Mutant XÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. For The Fam Volume 2 features 17 tracks including new Zodiac Mprint, unheard Dark Lotus (song from over 10 years ago), brand new Twiztid, some remixes, and forgotten skits.\n\n\nENJOY &amp; SEED\n\n \nIf you like Twiztid then buy all their shit, please support the artists you like this is years of hard work.
