MotherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Love is founded in Tiel, not far from Utrecht in the centre of the Netherlands. One year later two singles and an LP are released of which suprisingly, the album is also released in Italy. The LP is titled Take one and becomes an instant flop. Soon after that, the group name is changed into The Dream. Under this name the single The doting king is released in 1968. By then the band has already more success then they had with MotherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Love. During their existence over 1.000 concerts are given, with film projection psychedelic background. They also play Paris (Golfe Drouot), London (Speakeasy) and a couple of Dutch double-concerts with Pink Floyd in Amsterdam and Maastricht. In 1970 the band is invited for some popfestivals like Bilzen, Kralingen and the first edition of Pinkpop. They also perform on tv, for over an hour in the program Dit is het begin, where they perform parts of the rock-opera The peacock and the rat. Most important group member is Floris Kolvenbach, composing all songs and writing all the lyrics. In 1969 and 1971 two more singles are relased at minor success but in 1973 it is all over and the band folds. Floris Kolvenbach attracts attention afterwards with the project Mirakel Music and the experimental formation Metal Voices.\n\nTracklist:\n\n01 Rebellion (Can I Ask You One More Question) 2:39 \n02 Can You Hear Me Howlin\\' 3:33 \n03 Mr. V 3:24 \n04 The Netherlands 11:23 \n- a) The Netherlands \n- b) I Had a Dream \n- c) Money, Money, Money \n- d) Bigger and Bigger \n- e) To Be Rich \n05 Four Phonecalls 3:17 \n06 We\\'ll Be Back Yesterday Morning 2:29 \n07 Open the Gates 5:40 \n08 Dino 3:09 \n09 Met a Girl Today 3:26 \n10 The Diamond and the Fool 6:12 \n11 The Monarchy 5:06 \n12 Sleeping Rose 3:44 \n13 Still Alive 1:39 ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:88fb786cfb916c4856870f7150eddeb3b1f594dc","amp;dn":"The+Dream+-+The+Dream+Archives+%281968-71%29+%5Bmp3%40256%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"88fb786cfb916c4856870f7150eddeb3b1f594dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,251,120,108,251,145,108,72,86,135,15,113,80,237,222,179,177,245,148,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
