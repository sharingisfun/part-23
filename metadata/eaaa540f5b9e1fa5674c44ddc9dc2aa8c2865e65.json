Apu is now an adult seeking his fortune in the world and is an aspiring writer. One day, accompanying a friend to a wedding, Apu lands up marrying Aparna. Apu's happiness in finding his aoul mate is shortlived however, as Aparna dies at childbirth, leaving a son Kajol behind. A devastated Apu, leaves Kajol with his grandparents and goes travelling. Much later, he returns in his reunion with Kajol, both father and son find a meaning in life again..\r\n\r\nComments:\r\nFor me Apur Sansar has always been the favourite in the Trilogy. It is a more mature Ray than in Pather Panchali, the screenplay is much more complex with nuances that delight you when you think about them and Subrata Mitra's camera work is par excellence. This was also the last Ray film in which the music director is not Ray himself (Ravi Shankar). Shankar's musical genius is in full display in a restrained musical score that is in keeping with the earlier films of the Trilogy, lending a harmony that adds to the cinematic genius of Ray.\r\n\r\nUploader's Notes:\r\nThis is the last of the x264 rips of the Criterion Blu-Rays of the Apu Trilogy by Satyajit Ray. In this 720p rip, I have reduced the grain to some extent and compensated by slightly sharpening the underlying images before adding back some grain. Apart from that the original PCM sound has been reencoded to AC3 to free more space for the video. The result is a high quality rip which I hope will meet your expectations. Please check the sample. It is the scene where Apu first meets Aparna after their wedding.\r\n\r\nIMDB Link: \nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0052572/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eaaa540f5b9e1fa5674c44ddc9dc2aa8c2865e65","amp;dn":"APUR+SANSAR+%281958%29Criterion+BDRip-720p-x264+AC3-%5BDDR%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eaaa540f5b9e1fa5674c44ddc9dc2aa8c2865e65","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,170,84,15,91,158,31,165,103,76,68,221,201,220,42,168,194,134,94,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
