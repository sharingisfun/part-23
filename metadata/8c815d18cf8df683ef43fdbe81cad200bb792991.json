Author Marc Scott Zicree spent five years researching and writing what is without a doubt the definitive look at this classic horror-fantasy-science fiction show. (The series originally ran from 1959 to 1965, but is still seen in syndication around the world.) Not only is the book an exhaustive episode-by-episode guide, but the author apparently interviewed every living soul who was ever associated with the show. It's quite likely that creator Rod Serling, who died before the book saw publication in 1982, would have been suitably impressed by the respect and dedication that clearly went into this labor of love. Zicree later revised and expanded The Twilight Zone Companion for a second edition in 1989, and discusses both the briefly revived series and the feature film based on the show.\n\n\nLink here &gt; http://www.amazon.com/Twilight-Zone-Companion-Scott-Zicree/dp/1879505096\n\nPDF format - 457 pages\nIncludes cover images","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c815d18cf8df683ef43fdbe81cad200bb792991","amp;dn":"Twilight+Zone+Companion+-+Marc+Scott+Zicree+%281982%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c815d18cf8df683ef43fdbe81cad200bb792991","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,129,93,24,207,141,246,131,239,67,253,190,129,202,210,0,187,121,41,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
