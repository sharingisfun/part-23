What's caught everyone's interest, brought T-Model fame of sorts, is his quirky, down-home personality and the wild abandon of his slash-and-burn blues--both, of course, displayed here on his sophomore effort. Sorry to say, for at least half the album, Ford should have heeded the album title. The eccentric little talks of &quot;If I Had Wings, Parts 1 &amp; 2&quot; and the amplified blues of &quot;To the Left and the Right&quot; (with Spam on drums) inhabit a wasteland. Happily, a couple of tracks do merit repeated listens: mixer Jim Waters (Sonic Youth, Jon Spencer Blues Explosion) forges snippets of Ford's fey jabber and boogaloo on &quot;Pop Pop Pop,&quot; and Ford, playing solo guitar, provides a good, thoroughly lucid performance on &quot;The Old Number,&quot; which appears to be a variant of Robert Petway's age-old &quot;Catfish Blues.&quot;\n\n\nTracklist\n01.
