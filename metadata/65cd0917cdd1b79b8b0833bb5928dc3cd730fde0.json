Fabia has great fun fooling Alex, only she later learns that when he discovers her prank that he's not amused. Fabia allows a very painful experience with a rich playboy to paint her opinions of Alex in the same colour. Slowing through his persistence she begins to doubt her preconceived impressions. Fabia is torn by her attraction to Alex and by the voice in her heart that warns her that he's just like the one who hurt her. Alex hates that Fabia has stereotyped him because of his wealth and the press that comes with that wealth. Although we are not given his POV, it's clear that Alex cares deeply for Fabia even though she fails to see it until it's almost too late","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:65cd0917cdd1b79b8b0833bb5928dc3cd730fde0","amp;dn":"And+The+Bride+Wore+Black+-+Helen+Brooks","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"65cd0917cdd1b79b8b0833bb5928dc3cd730fde0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,205,9,23,205,209,183,155,139,8,51,187,89,40,220,60,215,48,253,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
