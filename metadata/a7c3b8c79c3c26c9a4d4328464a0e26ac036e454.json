The Peloponnesian War pitted Athens and her allies against a league of city-states headed by Sparta. Thucydides himself was an Athenian general in the fighting, sentenced to exile partway through the 27-year struggle, after losing a key battle to one of Sparta's leading commanders.\n\nAlthough Thucydides lived to see the end of the war, his history breaks off in its 21st year. Other ancient writers completed the record but without Thucydides's sense of drama and matchless insightÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½for he is the first historian to seek the true causes of events. His eyewitness account of the war has been a classic for 24 centuries and is still studied for its profound truths about the nature of human strife.\n\nIn this course, Professor Kenneth W. Harl draws on this masterpiece as well as other ancient sources to give you a full picture of the Greek world in uneasy peace and then all-out war in the late 5th century B.C.\n\n1.\tThucydides and the Peloponnesian War\n2.\tThe Greek Way of War\n3.\tSpartaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Perceptions and Prejudices\n4.\tSparta and Her Allies\n5.\tThe Athenian Democracy\n6.\tAthens and the Navy\n7.\tVictory over Persia, 490ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“479 B.C.\n8.\tAthens or SpartaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½A Question of Leadership\n9.\tCimonian Imperialism\n10.\tSparta after the Persian Wars\n11.\tThe First Peloponnesian War\n12.\tThe Thirty Years' Peace\n13.\tTriumph of the Radical Democracy\n14.\tFrom Delian League to Athenian Empire\n15.\tEconomy and Society of Imperial Athens\n16.\tAthens, School of Greece\n17.\tCrisis in Corcyra, 435ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“432 B.C.\n18.\tOutbreak of the Peloponnesian War\n19.\tStrategies and Stalemate, 431ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“429 B.C.\n20.\tAthenian Victory in Northwest Greece\n21.\tImperial CrisisÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½The Chalcidice and Mytilene\n22.\tPlague, Fiscal Crisis, and War\n23.\tDemagogues and Stasis\n24.\tPylos, 425 B.C.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½A Test of Leadership\n25.\tNew Leaders and New Strategies\n26.\tThe Peace of Nicias\n27.\tCollapse of the Peace of Nicias\n28.\tFrom Mantinea to Sicily, 418ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“415 B.C.\n29.\tSparta, Athens, and the Western Greeks\n30.\tThe Athenian Expedition to Sicily\n31.\tAlcibiades and Sparta, 414ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“412 B.C.\n32.\tConspiracy and Revolution, 411 B.C.\n33.\tAlcibiades and Athens, 411ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“406 B.C.\n34.\tThe Defeat of Athens, 406ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“404 B.C.\n35.\tSparta's Bitter Victory\n36.\tLessons of the Peloponnesian War","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a7c3b8c79c3c26c9a4d4328464a0e26ac036e454","amp;dn":"Thucydides+-+The+History+of+the+Peloponnesian+War","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a7c3b8c79c3c26c9a4d4328464a0e26ac036e454","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,195,184,199,156,60,38,201,164,212,50,132,100,160,226,106,192,54,228,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
