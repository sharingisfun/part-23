His previous works include Bumming in Beijing: The Last Dreamers (1990), 1966, My Life in the Red Guards (1993), and At Home in the World (1995).\n\nIn Fuck Cinema, armed with a single DV camera, Wu Wenguang turns the camera on the Chinese film industry, following Wang, a young man from the countryside, and his quest for success in the film industry. Wang moves to Beijing with hopes of becoming an actor, but finds himself struggling with no money and no home. WangÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s attentions then turn to getting his script directed, but his future appears equally bleakÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\nFuck Cinema becomes a commentary for the dark side of underground cinema, as Wang hopelessly pursues plans to turn his script into an underground film, with the perception that this status will gain him international success. Furthermore, the documentary ultimately becomes a reflection upon the role and the responsibility of independent filmmakers in China, for while Wang tries to find success through underground cinema, it is that same cinema that is using him as he becomes the hopeless subject of We WenguangÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s film.\n\nIn the wider sense Fuck Cinema presents the desperation of survival in modern China, unveiling the stark cruel unbalance between ChinaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s booming film industry, and those that are left struggling to become a part of it: the desperate Wang, trying to sell his script, young girls auditioning for the chance of a lifetime acting role as a prostitute, and a pirate film trader chased by the police.\n\nWE ARE AN ACADEMIC RESOURCE...
