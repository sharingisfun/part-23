How is it that a man from Pakistan can cross the border into 'hostile' territory and yet not feel 'foreign'? Is it the geography, the architecture, the food? Or is it the streets, the festivals and the colours of the subcontinent, so familiar and yes, beloved...\n\nAs he takes in the sights, from the Sufi shrines in the south to the markets of Old Delhi, from Lutyens' stately mansions to Ghalib's crumbling abode, Raza uncovers the many layers of the city. He connects with the richness of the Urdu language, observes the syncretic evolution of mystical Islam in India and its deep connections with Hindustani classical music Ã¢â‚¬â€œ so much a part of his own selfhood. And every so often, he returns to the refuge of Hazrat Nizamuddin Auliya, the twelfth-century pir, whose dargah still reverberates with music and prayer every evening.\n\nHis wanderings through Delhi lead Raza back in time to recollections of a long-forgotten Hindu ancestry and to comparisons with his own city of Lahore Ã¢â‚¬â€œ in many ways a mirror image of Delhi. They also lead to reflections on the nature of the modern city, the inherent conflict between the native and the immigrant and, inevitably, to an inquiry into his own identity as a South Asian Muslim.\n\nRich with history and anecdote, and conversations with Dilliwalas known and unknown,Delhi By Heart offers an unusual perspective and unexpected insights into the political and cultural capital of India.\n\nAbout the Author\nRaza Rumi is an international development professional based in Lahore. He has worked for national and international organizations such as the United Nations and the Asian Development Bank. He also edits and writes for the Friday Times and contributes to leading national dailies in Pakistan and abroad. He blogs at Jahane Rumi, a website devoted to Sufism and the arts and cultures of South Asia.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c79ab5a133e121e40952084725c634536b804a9d","amp;dn":"Delhi+by+Heart-+Impressions+of+a+Pakistani+Traveller+by+Raza+Rum","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c79ab5a133e121e40952084725c634536b804a9d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,154,181,161,51,225,33,228,9,82,8,71,37,198,52,83,107,128,74,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
