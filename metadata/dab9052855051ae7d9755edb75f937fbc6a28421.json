Beloved is to be released on February 18, 2014 on Epitaph Records in the US; February 14 in Australia.By their own admission, I Killed The Prom Queen have endured a decidedly checkered past. Over the years the band saw multiple vocalist changes and other personnel exchanges, side-project sojourns and moonlighting in other bands, hiatuses and break-ups. Yet through it all, their musical output both live and on record has remained thoroughly inspired.\n\nA brief history for the uninitiated: In 2000, IKTPQ formed in Adelaide, Australia. In 2002, the band released their first EP Choose to Love, Live or Die with their original member lineup. From 2003-2005, the band released a split with likeminded locals Parkway Drive, put out various releases, and experienced lineup changes. In 2006 with the release of their sophomore effort, Music For The Recently Deceased, the five-piece garnered local chart success and built a loyal worldwide following. However in 2008, mounting pressure and internal strife led to their premature demise. Yet, ironically, the hugely successful Ã¢â‚¬ËœSay GoodbyeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Australian tour, which was to be the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s swan song, gave them the impetus to continue\n\nFor several years the band lay dormant, as members went on to play in other bands. In 2011, I Killed The Prom Queen reclaimed their sound, style, history, and legacy with an all new lineup, and original member Jona Weinhofen who spent time with Bleeding Through and Bring Me The Horizon. Joined by new screamer Jamie Hope (ex- Red Shore), Shane O'Brien on drums, Kevin Cameron on guitar, Benjamin Coyte on bass, and of course, Jona bringing vocal choruses, guitar and keyboard to the mix.\n\nIKTPQ entered the studio in 2013 in Gothenburg, Sweden with Fredrik NordstrÃƒÂ¶m (Bring Me The Horizon, At The Gates, In Flames, Dimmu Brogir, Architects UK) to record Beloved, their much-anticipated third album of epic proportions.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve really extended ourselves,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ says Jona Weinhofen, Ã¢â‚¬Å“But weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve done it in a way where itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tasteful and it makes sense with the music. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not like weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve gone from sounding like a metalcore band to sounding like Dimmu Borgir. It still sounds very much like Prom Queen.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nHaving overcome so much adversity during their 13-year existence, I Killed The Prom Queen have a fresh lease on life and a newfound desire to leave an indelible mark on the world stage.\n\n\n\n \t\t00 album art 01.jpg\t                        59.14 KB\n \t\t01 Beginning Of The End.flac 44.1kHz 876kbps\t11.26 MB\n \t\t02 To The Wolves.flac 44.1kHz 1087kbps\t        26.44 MB\n \t\t03 Bright Enough.flac 44.1kHz 1083kbps\t        29.75 MB\n \t\t04 Melior.flac 44.1kHz 1089kbps\t                28.91 MB\n \t\t05 Thirty One &amp; Sevens.flac 44.1kHz 1094kbps\t26.82 MB\n \t\t06 Calvert Street.flac 44.1kHz 1082kbps\t        27.59 MB\n \t\t07 Kjaerlighet.flac 44.1kHz 1028kbps\t        27.95 MB\n \t\t08 The Beaten Path.flac 44.1kHz 1082kbps\t26.95 MB\n \t\t09 Nightmares.flac 44.1kHz 1050kbps\t        22.86 MB\n \t\t10 No One Will Save Us.flac 44.1kHz 1099kbps\t23.64 MB\n \t\t11 Brevity.flac 44.1kHz 1047kbps\t        38.56 MB\n \t\tBeloved.cue\t                                 1.24 KB\n \t\tI Killed The Prom Queen - Beloved.m3u\t          853 bytes\n \t\tz. audiochecker main log file.log\t         2.58 KB\n \t\tz. audiochecker.log\t                          757 bytes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dab9052855051ae7d9755edb75f937fbc6a28421","amp;dn":"I+Killed+The+Prom+Queen+-+Beloved+%28flac%29+%5BMentalZero%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dab9052855051ae7d9755edb75f937fbc6a28421","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,185,5,40,85,5,26,231,217,117,94,219,117,249,55,251,198,162,132,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
