After the Sugarcubes and Bj&amp;ouml;rk, Gus Gus and more recently Sigur R&amp;oacute;s, M&amp;uacute;m is now proving to be the freshest act to hail from the North Atlantic isle. Formed in 1997 after Gunnar &amp;Ouml;rn Tynes and &amp;Ouml;rvar &amp;THORN;&amp;oacute;reyjarson Sm&amp;aacute;rason spotted Gy&amp;eth;a and Krist&amp;iacute;n Anna Valt&amp;yacute;sd&amp;oacute;ttir, then aged 15, during a concert of the band they used to be in, M&amp;uacute;m is the unlikely combination of four diverging talents. Gunnar started playing music on his old Amiga, producing hardcore techno, while &amp;Ouml;rvar discovered the joys of electronic music when his parents bought a computer and he needed some music for a video game he had just written. With the two classically trained twin sisters on board, M&amp;uacute;m was ready to start exploring original ways of producing poetic electronic music.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c8111ed4a0dba467c54bf44a48b5ddfa02f8ee0d","amp;dn":"M%C3%BAm+-+Finally+We+Are+No+One+%5B2002%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c8111ed4a0dba467c54bf44a48b5ddfa02f8ee0d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,17,30,212,160,219,164,103,197,75,244,74,72,181,221,250,2,248,238,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
