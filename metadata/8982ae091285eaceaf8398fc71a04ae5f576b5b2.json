From the grand, Parisian style city centre to the multi coloured tenements of the historic Boca district and just about everything in between, Judith uncovers a breathtakingly beautiful city with a rich and multi-faceted culture.  \n\nJudith gets the Argentine take on Evita outside the Casa Rosada, enjoys a sultry tango lesson at her hotel and explores the overflowing antique markets of the bohemian barrio of San Telmo. \n\nShe learns the secrets of Buenos Aires high society at Recoleta Cemetery and takes in the sites, sounds and smells of the countryside at the Gaucho street fair in the cities meat packing district.  But nothing compares to her night on the tiles at one of Buenos AiresÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ trendiest Tango clubs where the cities sense of style and passion shine.\n\nBut JudithÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s adventure doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t stop there.  On two day excursions from the city Judith takes a ferry across the Rio del la Plata to the picturesque Uruguayan village of Colonia and flies west to the region of Mendoza, famous for its wine and breath taking mountain scenery.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8982ae091285eaceaf8398fc71a04ae5f576b5b2","amp;dn":"16x03.BUENOS+AIRES.HDrip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8982ae091285eaceaf8398fc71a04ae5f576b5b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,130,174,9,18,133,234,206,175,131,152,252,113,160,74,229,245,118,181,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
