I came home late and went back as far as I could (5 hours) and just hit record and let it go for a while in hopes of catching the whole show. I think it starts in the middle of the show or toward the end, but the file is 7.5 hours so if they replayed the whole show again it should be there. I dont know about wrap up though. Please comment after you listen, because I haven't listened to it yet. I'm still listening to shows from June but I wanted to post this for everyone else. Again, sorry if its not what I thought, but it was recorded on the last replay of the day and I figured it was this or nothing (unless anyone else has the show &amp; wrap up?)\n\n~Phoenixx","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c13fe2c4880ed333632989cae4ad806d5dbbd52e","amp;dn":"Howard+Stern+7-9-14","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c13fe2c4880ed333632989cae4ad806d5dbbd52e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,63,226,196,136,14,211,51,99,41,137,202,228,173,128,109,93,187,213,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
