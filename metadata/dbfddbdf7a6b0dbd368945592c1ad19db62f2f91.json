It was unveiled at the GOTO conference in Aarhus, 2011 October 10-12. The goal of Dart is &quot;ultimately to replace JavaScript as the lingua franca of web development on the open web platform.&quot;[2] Dart is intended to solve JavaScript's problems (which, according to a leaked memo, cannot be solved by evolving the language) while offering better performance, the ability &quot;to be more easily tooled for large-scale projects&quot; and better security features.[2] Google is also working on Dart to help it build more complex, full-featured client-side Web apps.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dart_(programming_language)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dart_(programming_language)&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.dartlang.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.dartlang.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dbfddbdf7a6b0dbd368945592c1ad19db62f2f91","amp;dn":"%5BDart+Programming+Language+%5D+What+is+Dart%3F","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dbfddbdf7a6b0dbd368945592c1ad19db62f2f91","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,253,219,223,122,107,13,189,54,137,69,89,44,26,209,157,182,47,47,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
