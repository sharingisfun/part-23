This manual, written by a nationally recognized furniture maker, provides intermediate and advanced woodworkers with well illustrated, step-by-step instructions for classic Greene &amp; Greene details, including ebony plugs, cloud lifts, leg indents, brackets, and pulls. A discussion of the design philosophy of the period accompanies how-to chapters, and photographs of contemporary Greene-inspired furniture provide ideas for projects. Biographical sketches are included for Charles and Henry Greene, Peter and John Hall (who built most of the furniture), and competing furniture maker Gustav Stickley.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:60dbaaa8080efb84da16f19942d5565e51ce01aa","amp;dn":"Design+Elements+for+the+Workshop","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"60dbaaa8080efb84da16f19942d5565e51ce01aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,219,170,168,8,14,251,132,218,22,241,153,66,213,86,94,81,206,1,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
