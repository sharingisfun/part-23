This second book of thetwo volume set is focussing on complex flavoproteins and physical methods. Itgivesimportant new insights into the reaction mechanisms of flavin-containing enzymes and the role of flavoproteins in cell signalling pathways,and isan essential reference for all researchers in biochemistry, chemistry, photochemistry and photophysics working on flavoenzymes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c9096fa2e0c1eac0e8b47873a1513b405299bf34","amp;dn":"Handbook+of+Flavoproteins+Vol.+2+-+Complex+Flavoproteins%2C+Dehydr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c9096fa2e0c1eac0e8b47873a1513b405299bf34","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,9,111,162,224,193,234,192,232,180,120,115,161,81,59,64,82,153,191,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
