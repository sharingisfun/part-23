Gathered from 2004-2006, these comics range from touching and somber to downright silly. In the title comic, a little black ghost has his head in the clouds at work, fixating on a hook-up from the previous evening. Another comic ends with the author, Tinder, having his face eaten by a grizzly bear. This volume is tiny, but tightly-packed with stories that will touch your heart and make you realize you're not the only one out there that has these thoughts running through your head. Also contains never-before-seen material.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e09792c4716a35f30366682f4c076fef59a4fdbf","amp;dn":"Jeremy+Tinder+-+Black+Ghost+Apple+Factory","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e09792c4716a35f30366682f4c076fef59a4fdbf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,151,146,196,113,106,53,243,3,102,104,47,76,7,111,239,89,164,253,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
