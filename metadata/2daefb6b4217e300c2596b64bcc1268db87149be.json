In the past decade, a series of remarkable solutions to long-standing problems in C*-algebra using set-theoretic methods, many achieved by the author and his collaborators, have generated new interest in this subject. This is the first book aimed at explaining forcing to general mathematicians. It simultaneously makes the subject broadly accessible by explaining it in a clear, simple manner, and surveys advanced applications of set theory to mainstream topics.\nReadership: Graduates and researchers in logic and set theory, general mathematical audience","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2daefb6b4217e300c2596b64bcc1268db87149be","amp;dn":"Forcing+for+Mathematicians+%5BMyeBookShelf%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2daefb6b4217e300c2596b64bcc1268db87149be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,174,251,107,66,23,227,0,194,89,107,100,188,193,38,141,184,113,73,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
