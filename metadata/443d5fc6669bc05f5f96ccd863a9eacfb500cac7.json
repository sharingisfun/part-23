So contends the eminent psychiatrist and writer Dr. Theodore Isaac Rubin, whose views on one of the most powerful of human emotions can change your life. If you feel you've got to smile when you want to snarl, he can remind you that suppressed or twisted anger can lead to anxiety, depression, insomnia, psychosomatic illness, alcoholism,\nfrigidity, impotence, and downright misery. So let Dr. Rubin show you how to be what you really are: a human being.\n\n&quot;If his observations are correct, the screamers among us are doing all right.
