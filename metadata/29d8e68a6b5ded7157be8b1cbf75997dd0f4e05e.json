Manahan, &quot;Fundamentals of Environmental and Toxicological Chemistry: Sustainable Science, Fourth Edition&quot;\n\n2013 | ISBN-10: 1466553162 | 614 pages | PDF | 41 MB\n\nFundamentals of Environmental and Toxicological Chemistry: Sustainable Science, Fourth Edition covers university-level environmental chemistry, with toxicological chemistry integrated throughout the book. This new edition of a bestseller provides an updated text with an increased emphasis on sustainability and green chemistry. It is organized based on the five spheres of EarthÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s environment: (1) the hydrosphere (water), (2) the atmosphere (air), (3) the geosphere (solid Earth), (4) the biosphere (life), and (5) the anthrosphere (the part of the environment made and used by humans).\n\nThe first chapter defines environmental chemistry and each of the five environmental spheres. The second chapter presents the basics of toxicological chemistry and its relationship to environmental chemistry. Subsequent chapters are grouped by sphere, beginning with the hydrosphere and its environmental chemistry, water pollution, sustainability, and water as natureÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most renewable resource. Chapters then describe the atmosphere, its structure and importance for protecting life on Earth, air pollutants, and the sustainability of atmospheric quality. The author explains the nature of the geosphere and discusses soil for growing food as well as geosphere sustainability. He also describes the biosphere and its sustainability","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:29d8e68a6b5ded7157be8b1cbf75997dd0f4e05e","amp;dn":"Fundamentals+of+Environmental+and+Toxicological+Chemistry","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"29d8e68a6b5ded7157be8b1cbf75997dd0f4e05e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,216,230,138,107,93,237,113,87,190,139,28,191,117,153,125,208,244,224,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
