I had to search for a long time and navigate a swedish rock forum to find a rapidshit of it. My internet isn&amp;#039;t extremely fast, so be patient the first few folks who download it. I&amp;#039;ll try and keep online as a seeder for a couple days at least.\n\nHeres what the Sigur Ros website has to say about the EP:\n\n\nin early 2001, sigur rÃƒÂ³s set out to record some songs in their newly-completed ÃƒÂ¡lafoss swimming pool studio with their friend steindÃƒÂ³r andersen. steindÃƒÂ³r andersen is a fisherman and chairman of the icelandic poetry society, called iÃƒÂ°unn. steindÃƒÂ³r is a chanter/singer of the traditional icelandic epic poetry form called rÃƒÂ­mur. rÃƒÂ­mur are narrative poems which generally tell stories of icelandic heroes and epic battles which have been passed down generations in iceland through word-of-mouth since the 14th century. rÃƒÂ­mur were regarded as a performance art; a good rÃƒÂ­mur chanter would engage his listeners with his clever rhyming schemes and catchy melodies. rÃƒÂ­mur were performed on winter nights when inhabitants sat occupied by their work (making clothing from wool, wreathing horsehairs into ropes, cutting tools from wood, etc.) for seven centuries, this was icelanders&amp;#039; only branch of entertainment and it&amp;#039;s only recently that this tradition has dissolved.\n\nthe steindÃƒÂ³r andersen ep contains six songs, three of which sigur rÃƒÂ³s accompany him on. two songs feature steindÃƒÂ³r alone and the last song on the cd is steindÃƒÂ³r and his friend sigurÃƒÂ°ur sigurÃƒÂ°arson singing the poem l?kurinn (the stream), recorded under the bridge of the stream by sigur rÃƒÂ³s&amp;#039;s studio.\n\n1000 copies of the cd were printed and sold in the spring tour of 2001, where steindÃƒÂ³r joined the band to perform the songs from the ep. (here is a photo of steindÃƒÂ³r performing with the band.) the cd was sold in a blank white paper case and the artwork on the cd itself was minimal. there are currently no plans to release this cd.\n\nhere you can read what steindÃƒÂ³r is chanting on all six tracks.\n\nhere is a video (quicktime format / 4:07 mins / 3.0 mb) of steindÃƒÂ³r performing &amp;#039;hugann seiÃƒÂµa svalli frÃƒÂ¡&amp;#039; with sigur rÃƒÂ³s at the small pub across the street from the band&amp;#039;s studio in ÃƒÂ¡lafoss.\ntracklist\n\n   1. kem ÃƒÂ©g enn af kÃƒÂ¶ldum heiÃƒÂ°um (with sigur rÃƒÂ³s) [6:18 mins]\n   2. til ei ltur tÃƒÂ­ÃƒÂ°in mÃƒÂ©r (solo) [1:00 mins]\n   3. fjÃƒÂ¶ll ÃƒÂ­ austri fagurblÃƒÂ¡ (with sigur rÃƒÂ³s) [6:00 mins]\n   4. slÃƒÂ¦r ÃƒÂ¡ hafiÃƒÂ° himinblÃƒÂ¦ (solo) [1:28 mins]\n   5. hugann seiÃƒÂ°a svalli frÃƒÂ¡ (with sigur rÃƒÂ³s) [6:02 mins]\n   6. lÃƒÂ¦kurinn (duet with sigurÃƒÂ°ur sigurÃƒÂ°arson) [5:49 mins]\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:77e00a2314e61ee33bff9625a3ce3bdec4d5cb80","amp;dn":"Sigur+Ros+-+Rimur+EP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"77e00a2314e61ee33bff9625a3ce3bdec4d5cb80","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,224,10,35,20,230,30,227,59,255,150,37,163,206,59,222,196,213,203,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
