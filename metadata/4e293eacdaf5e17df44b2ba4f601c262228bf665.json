XDK also comes with a drag-and-drop UI builder, an emulator and a debugging environment. In this course, we'll go over all of these tools and see how they can be used together for rapid app development.\nParse is a cloud-based database and back-end infrastructure. Parse allows us to easily configure a back-end with structured data and media storage, so we can focus on the user experience.\nTo create our magazine app, we'll create a simple HTML interface to our Parse back-end. Then, with the power of XDK, our app development will be as simple as drag-and-drop!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e293eacdaf5e17df44b2ba4f601c262228bf665","amp;dn":"TutsPlus+-+Build+Apps+With+XDK+and+Parse","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e293eacdaf5e17df44b2ba4f601c262228bf665","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,41,62,172,218,245,225,125,244,75,43,164,246,1,194,98,34,139,246,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
