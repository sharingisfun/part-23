(Imagine a version of Stand by Me in which not all of the kids outrace the train.) Like Art Spiegelman did with Maus, Jason utilizes anthropomorphic stylizations to reach deeper, more general truths, and to create elegantly minimalist panels whose emotional depth charge comes as an even greater shock. His sparse dialogue, dark wit, and supremely bold use of &quot;jump-cuts&quot; from one scene to the next (sometimes spanning a number of years) make Hey, Wait... a surprising and engaging debut. Love and Rockets co-creator Gilbert Hernandez calls this one of the best graphic novels ever. - See more at: http://www.fantagraphics.com/browse-shop/hey-wait-.-with-free-signed-bookplate.html#sthash.qX59CjOB.dpuf","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bbb416048f92133942c34eec57dd92480b6d4176","amp;dn":"Jason%3A+Hey%2C+Wait.....+%28Fantagraphics%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bbb416048f92133942c34eec57dd92480b6d4176","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,180,22,4,143,146,19,57,66,195,78,236,87,221,146,72,11,109,65,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
