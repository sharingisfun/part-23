The original blocks and many of the pattern adaptations have therefore been retained. However, the great expansion of casual wear, cut in jersey or stretch fabrics, has led to the growth of Ã¢â‚¬Ëœflat cuttingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ with no darting to create the shape and this edition devotes a whole section to this type of cutting. The sections on computer-aided design and grading have been updated. The size charts of body measurements have been revised, reflecting the changing shape of womenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bodies.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8aa7d192600905d9b3bb7763fa1250711e5c0780","amp;dn":"Metric+Pattern+Cutting+%7Eariane_c","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8aa7d192600905d9b3bb7763fa1250711e5c0780","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,167,209,146,96,9,5,217,179,187,119,99,250,18,80,113,30,92,7,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
