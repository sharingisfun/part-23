If it appears that part of the description is missing, you can always find it in the show info text file included with each torrent.\n\n\n\nScheduled Guests\n................\n\n\n\nToday Alex welcomes Dr. Michael Coffman, author of &quot;Rescuing a Broken America, why America is Deeply Divided and How to Heal it Constitutionally&quot;. \n[most of hour 3]\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.discerningtoday.org/dr__michael_coffman.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.discerningtoday.org/dr__michael_coffman.htm&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.republicmagazine.com/webinar/dr-michael-coffman-ph-d-a-climate-of-fear-the-global-warming-scam.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.republicmagazine.com/webinar/dr-michael-coffman-ph-d-a-climate-of-fear-the-global-warming-scam.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nAlex also covers the latest news and takes calls.\n\nAlex also spends time with Chicago shock-jock radio personality, Matthew Erich &quot;Mancow&quot; Muller\n[end of hour 2, first part of hour 3]\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.mancow.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.mancow.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nAlex spent a fair amount of time talking about an article by Jonah Lehrer in one of Wired.com's science blogs, The Frontal Cortex.\nThe article, titled &quot;The Brain Eating Vaccine Conspiracy,&quot; is a response to the brain-eating-virus meme that Alex launched yesterday.\nExpect Alex to really attack Lehrer tomorrow. I recommend that you read his article before listening to tomorrow's Jones show, or if possible, before listening to today's show.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.wired.com/wiredscience/frontal-cortex&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.wired.com/wiredscience/frontal-cortex&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_torrents_info_PLEASE-READ.txt\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n \n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential \n to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a\n spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the &quot;big \n picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media \n for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to\n share information that counters the monotone of mainstream\n corporate media. \n\n NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as\n information.
