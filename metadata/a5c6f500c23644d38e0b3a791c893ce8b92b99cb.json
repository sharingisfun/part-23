Im not trying to take any credit for these either, just passing them along for anyone that might need them. \nThe exe obviously wonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t work either because the game will need cracking first.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a5c6f500c23644d38e0b3a791c893ce8b92b99cb","amp;dn":"Deus+ex+human+revolution+game+files","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a5c6f500c23644d38e0b3a791c893ce8b92b99cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,198,245,0,194,54,68,211,142,11,58,121,28,137,60,232,185,43,153,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
