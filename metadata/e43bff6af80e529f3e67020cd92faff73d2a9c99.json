After the band's breakthrough in 1988 with the release of &quot;I Want Your Love&quot;, &quot;Revolution Baby&quot; was subsequently reissued, this time reaching #30 in the UK and #24 in Australia. The sleeve design differed radically between the 1987 and 1988 issues as did the track listings.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e43bff6af80e529f3e67020cd92faff73d2a9c99","amp;dn":"Transvision+Vamp+%281988%29+Revolution+Baby.mpg","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e43bff6af80e529f3e67020cd92faff73d2a9c99","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,59,255,106,248,14,82,159,62,103,2,12,217,47,175,247,61,42,156,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
