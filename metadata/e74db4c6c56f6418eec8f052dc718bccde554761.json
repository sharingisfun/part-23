The main thesis of this book is that the Greeks started their history as a multi-ethnic population group consisting of both Greek-speaking newcomers and the indigenous population of the land, and that the body of 'Hellenes' as known to us from the historical period was a deliberate self-creation.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e74db4c6c56f6418eec8f052dc718bccde554761","amp;dn":"Greeks+and+Pre-Greeks+-+Aegean+Prehistory+and+Greek+Heroic+Tradi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e74db4c6c56f6418eec8f052dc718bccde554761","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,77,180,198,197,111,100,24,238,200,240,82,220,113,139,204,222,85,71,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
