It is the third installment in The Elder Scrolls series of games. It was released in North America in 2002 for Microsoft Windows and the Xbox. Well-received publicly and critically, selling over four million copies and winning more than 60 awards, including Game of the Year, Morrowind holds an average review score of 89% from both Metacritic and Game Rankings.The game spawned two expansion packs for the PC: Tribunal and Bloodmoon. Both were eventually repackaged into a full set containing all three, Morrowind: Game of the Year Edition, which shipped on October 30, 2003 for both PC and Xbox.\n\nThe story takes place on Vvardenfell, an island in the Dunmer province of Morrowind, which lies in the empire of Tamriel and is far from the more civilized lands to the west and south that typified Daggerfall and Arena. The central quests concern the deity Dagoth Ur, housed within the volcanic Red Mountain, who seeks to gain power and break Morrowind free from Imperial reign. Morrowind was designed with an open-ended free-form style of gameplay in mind, with a lessened emphasis on the game&amp;#039;s main plot. This choice received mixed reviews in the gaming press, though such feelings were tempered by reviewers&amp;#039; appreciation of Morrowind&amp;#039;s expansive and detailed game world.\n\nThis is a new Release of Morrowind and its initial expansion, Bloodmoon. Tribunal has not been included as the Federation feels it damages game play. Many releases of Morrowind have existed since its inception. While the original releases and many subsequent releases did contain all the necessary files for a clean install of the third Elder Scrolls&amp;#039; game, they were flawed by two critical Vista stability issues, and frequent playability problems. By utilizing a new wrapper of Microsoft DirectX through the MGEgui mod and complete rebuilds of the games textures through a multitude of graphic enhancement mods the Federation has been able to release a version of Morrowind which is portable, completely stable, and possesses graphics which in many instances are better than those of Elders Scrolls IV: Oblivion. \n\nThe Federation also included in this release a multiplayer function. This two player co-op function is provided through a bundled version of Morrowind Online which has been modified for stability. While the Federation has been able to improve the mod&amp;#039;s stability, the original issues which led to this mod being abandoned remain, primarily the inability to save new character data. This mod will allow any two single player characters to meet and traverse the world together. The Federation considers these issues to be inconsequential as the main purpose of this release is to provide accessibility by resolving vista-related installation and gameplay issues.\n\nAs this release is a &quot;common&quot; Federal release it will receive updates.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                              Miscellaneous Notes\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPlease Note The Following:\n\n.I.\nThe Federation takes no responsibility for any damage that may come to your computer through the utilization of this Crack-Mod. This mod has been tested to work on Windows XP and Vista. No support or technical assistance will be provided. Ever. Creation of this mod-crack took many hours of unpaid labour. \n.II.\nThe mods utilized in this release were originally made by the hundreds of unique modders (Quarl, Timeslip, etc.)  who neither support nor condone software piracy. The Federation has released their work without their permission.\n.III.\nThis release contains female nudity through the utilization of the Better Bodies Mod. Male nudity has been omitted in light of cultural sensitivity.\n.IV.\nTo all the Fans, Friends, Foes, Members and Affiliates, of the FEDERATION:\n\n\t\t\t-----------------------\n\t\t\t|THANKS FOR EVERYTHING| \n                        -----------------------\n\nBecause of you we are &quot;STILL UNDERGROUND&quot; and &quot;STILL ALIVE&quot;.\n[54686f73652057686f204b6e6f772055732043616e2046696e64205573]\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                 Install Notes\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSteps:\n\n(1.) Extract the &quot;Morrowind Co-op.rar&quot; file to a directory of your choice and then Navigate to the extracted (by default &quot;Morrowind Co-op&quot;) directory. Double-click on the &quot;Morrowind_Shortcuts.exe&quot; program. This program makes no changes to the game or system files which are already updated, modded, and cracked).\n\n(2.) Click through the installation instructions. Make certain that you install \nthe shortcut program to the &quot;Morrowind Co-op&quot; directory.\n\n(3.) Open the desired shortcut (which by default is) located on your desktop to \nstart the game. \n\n[Shortcut Information]:\n\n&quot;Morrowind&quot;                         - Single player Morrowind\n&quot;Morrowind Co-op&quot;                   - Singleplayer and Multiplayer Morrowind\n&quot;Morrowind Graphics Enhanced&quot;\t    - Dirrect X Wrapping Utility\n\n[Extras]: The official cover is included in the \t\t\t&quot;.Morrowind Co-opExtrasCovers&quot; directory.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                 Multiplayer Notes\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFollow these steps to begin a multiplayer session:\n\n[1]: Open the &quot;Morrowind Co-op&quot; shortcut. This should open a small window with a big Yellow label.\n\n[2a]: If you intend on connecting to another player, type their IP address in the boxes on the top right and hit Connect.\n\n[2b]: Once connected, the label will turn green for confirmation. This program uses Port 6112\n\n[3]: When both players press Transplant, Bamf will query your peer for any object definitions and media files necessary for your character to manifest.  Any resources found lacking on one peer will be compressed and sent by the other.  \n\n[4]: Once both players are ready, you may both press the &quot;Launch Morrowind Online&quot; button on the &quot;Morrowind Online&quot; interface.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                  In The Pipeline\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nT-BOX - ZKZ of the Federation Team\n\nGames - Pending\nEMUs  - Complete\nNFO   - Pending\nTest  - Complete\n\nThis release is imminent. This project seeks to combine a Lite (less than 700m)\nVista build, bootscreen, frontend, registry tweaks, several related \napplications, twenty-plus emulators and tens of thousands of various game \nimages and roms in an orderly package. This package would then allow a user \nto easily create a SF personal computer (or any other light PC) that would \nact as any console from the first to sixth generation. This has been a huge\nundertaking but if it is successful this project will provide the PC scene with \nthe first real replacement for consoles. Please understand that projects like \nthis one can have unsuspected kinks. Please be patient.\n\nHalf Life Decay Co-op - The Decay Team\n\nGame  - Pending\nCrack - Pending\nNFO   - Pending\nMod   - Pending\nTest  - Pending\n\nWe are currently waiting for the Decay Team to release their Beta port (long \noverdue). Once they do, the game will be cracked (if necessary) and released \nA.S.A.P.\n\nQuake 4 Ultimate Co-op - Opencoop\n\nGame  - Pending\nCrack - Pending\nNFO   - Pending\nMod   - Pending\nTest  - Pending\n\nAs many of you know opencoop recently released a tech demo of their next project Quake 4 Co-op which allows you to traverse most of the levels, with large amounts of lag, glitches, and crashes. Once they have a clean version working, this Crack-Mod will be released. Because we are waiting for them to finish their work there is no release date.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                  Recent Releases\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDiablo - Ultimate UPD*\t \t        |Sonic Comics Collection\n\t\t\t\t\t|\nGame  - Complete\t\t\t|Lib   - Complete\nCrack - Complete\t\t\t|NFO   - Complete\nNFO   - Complete\t\t\t|Test  - Complete\nTest  - Complete\t\t\t|URL   - http://thepiratebay.se/tor/\nURL   - http://thepiratebay.se/tor/\t|3933117/Sonic_Comics_Collection\n4260899\t\t\t\t\t|\n\nRoxio Easy Media Creator\t \t|Vampire Masquerade:Ultimate Bloodlines\n                                        |\nApp   - Complete\t\t\t|Game  - Complete\nCrack - Complete\t\t\t|Crack - Complete\nNFO   - Complete\t\t\t|NFO   - Complete\t\t\t\nTest  - Complete\t\t\t|Mod   - Complete\nURL   - http://thepiratebay.se/tor/\t|Test  - Complete\n3938149/ Roxio_Easy_Media_Creator_Suite_|URL   - http://thepiratebay.se/tor/\n10_Multilanguage (Final)\t\t|4218464/Doom_III_-_Ultimate_Co-op_\n\t\t\t\t\t\nDoom 3 Ultimate Co-op - Opencoop FINAL* |Half-Life Ultimate Co-op - Sven FINAL* \n\t\t\t\t\t|\nGame  - Complete\t\t\t|Game  - Complete\nCrack - Complete\t\t\t|Crack - Complete\nNFO   - Complete\t\t\t|NFO   - Complete\nMod   - Complete\t\t\t|Mod   - Complete\nTest  - Complete\t\t\t|Test  - Complete\nURL   - http://thepiratebay.se/tor/4218|URL   - http://thepiratebay.se/tor/ \n464/Doom_III_-_Ultimate_Co-op_(Final)   |4236344\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nHalf-Life 2 Co-op - Synergy UPD*        |Far Cry - A-C LAN Co-op FINAL*\n                                        |\nGame  - Complete\t\t\t|Game  - Complete\nCrack - Complete\t\t\t|Crack - Complete\nNFO   - Complete\t\t\t|NFO   - Complete\nTest  - Complete\t\t\t|Test  - Complete\nURL   - http://thepiratebay.se/tor/\t|URL   - http://thepiratebay.se/tor/ \n4262500/\t\t\t\t|4268119/\n\t\t\t\t \nMass Effect - Portable FINAL*\t\t|Quake 2 - Co-op UPD*\n                                        |\nGame  - Complete\t\t\t|Game  - Complete\nCrack - Complete\t\t\t|Crack - Complete\nNFO   - Complete\t\t\t|NFO   - Complete\nTest  - Complete\t\t\t|Test  - Complete\nURL   - http://thepiratebay.se/tor/\t|URL   - http://thepiratebay.se/tor/\n4274655/\t\t\t\t|4363733/\n\nDiablo 2 - Ultimate FINAL*\t\t|Civilization 2 - Ultimate FINAL*\n                                        |\nGame  - Complete\t\t\t|Game  - Complete\nCrack - Complete\t\t\t|Crack - Complete\nNFO   - Complete\t\t\t|NFO   - Complete\nTest  - Complete\t\t\t|Test  - Complete\nURL   - http://thepiratebay.se/tor/\t|URL   - Pending\n4363727/\t\t\t\t|\t\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                  Known Issues\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n(1.) Corruption - The Multiplayer function of this release corrupts the single player save files used. For that reason a script is used to backup of all saved files before a multiplayer game begins. These files can be found in the backup folder.\n\n(2.) Portability - Altering settings through the &quot;Morrowind Graphic Enhanced&quot; shortcut will add files to the registry, thus negating the portability of this release.\n\n(3.) Functionality - All the Co-op function currently allows you to accomplish is traversing the world with your friend, and/or exchanging items temporarily. The results of one player&amp;#039;s effects on the world are not duplicated within the game.\n \n(4.) Vista - Vista users who experience freezing (this is caused by a rare scripting error) should disable the MGEgui mod through the &quot;Morrowind Graphics Enhanced&quot; shortcut, which is by default set on their desktop.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                  Federal Rule\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIf you like this game, BUY IT.\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1bb1225e42e22ac5ba6b4f7a3745bcbb9c10c30e","amp;dn":"Morrowind+Co-op+%5BPortable%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1bb1225e42e22ac5ba6b4f7a3745bcbb9c10c30e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,177,34,94,66,226,42,197,186,107,79,122,55,69,188,187,156,16,195,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
