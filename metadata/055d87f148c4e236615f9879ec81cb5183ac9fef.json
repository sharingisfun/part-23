Meanwhile, rave-surfing mates Josh (Ricky Champ) and Adam (Gareth Llewelyn) bicker over money and girls as they wander Thailand. In India, laidback Liam (Chris ODowd) tries mightily to escape his past. Finally, fragile Marion (Eva Loebau, star of The Forest for the Trees), eagerly partakes various self-help programs in the new age-y meditation center Happy Home, hoping to dull the pain of a disintegrating relationship. A crafty critique of anglo twentysomethings adrift in an Asia they mistakenly believe to be a cleansing pleasure palace.\n\nIf you like traveling in Thailand,India...and like the travling crazy life you love this movie !!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:055d87f148c4e236615f9879ec81cb5183ac9fef","amp;dn":"Hotel+Very+Welcome+DVDRip+2007","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"055d87f148c4e236615f9879ec81cb5183ac9fef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,93,135,241,72,196,226,54,97,95,152,121,236,129,203,81,131,172,159,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
