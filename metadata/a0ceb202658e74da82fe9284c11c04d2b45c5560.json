By 1960, the group had gelled superbly, and much of their essential, original repertoire was in place, including John Lewis's composition &quot;Odds Against Tomorrow,&quot; the moody and profound theme from a film score, and the light, baroque-influenced pieces &quot;Colombine&quot; and &quot;Pulcinella.&quot; What stands out is the acute consciousness of sound, in Kay's sparkling drumming and Percy Heath's warmly resonant bass, as well as Lewis's piano and Milt Jackson's vibraphone. There's a superb economy of means practiced by the entire band, with scarcely a superfluous note in the two hours of music heard here. The treatments of standards are as memorable as the originals. ~ Stuart Broomer \n\nThis excellent 2-CD set provides an invaluable record of what the Modern Jazz Quartet sounded like at the height of their powers and under circumstances that must have been close to ideal: performing live in concert before an appreciative but discriminating audience. Fortunately, they were also blessed, on this occasion, with very good acoustics and a talented recording engineer. The resulting document is monaural, but it has terrific clarity, warmth, and presence. \n\nAll in all, this is probably the best representation of what the Modern Jazz Quartet was all about that is currently available. (&quot;European Concert,&quot; which was recorded during the same tour, is also extremely good, though not quite as comprehensive; unfortunately, it is currently out of print.) ~ Buddy Bolden\n\nPersonnel: Milt Jackson ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ vibraphone\nJohn Lewis - piano\nPercy Heath - bass\nConnie Kay - Drums\n\nModern Jazz Quartet - Dedicated to Connie CD 1 of 2 Tracks:\n01  The Little Comedy/La Cantatrice/Harlequin/Fontessa ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 23:05\n02  ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Round Midnight ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:09\n03  The Cylinder ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:02\n04  BagsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Groove ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:28\n05  Odds Against Tomorrow ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 8:12\n06  It DonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Mean a Thing (If It AinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Got That Swing) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:13\n07  A Social Call ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:52\n\nModern Jazz Quartet - Dedicated to Connie CD 2 of 2 Tracks:\n01  Django ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:40\n02  I Should Care ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:14\n03  How High the Moon ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7:51\n04  Colombine/Pulcinella ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 9:22\n05  Spanish Steps ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:08\n06  Pyramid (Blues for Junior) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 10:41\n07  Milt Meets Sid ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:40\n08  I Remember Clifford ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:03\n09  Vendome ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:42\n10  Skating in Central Park ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:10","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a0ceb202658e74da82fe9284c11c04d2b45c5560","amp;dn":"Modern+Jazz+Quartet+-+Dedicated+to+Connie+CD+2+of+2+%281960%29+%5BJazz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a0ceb202658e74da82fe9284c11c04d2b45c5560","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,206,178,2,101,142,116,218,130,254,146,132,193,28,4,210,180,92,85,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
