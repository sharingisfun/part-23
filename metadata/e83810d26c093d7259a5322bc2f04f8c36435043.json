The songs were written by Ray Davies and include both standard rock/pop songs and instrumental numbers.&quot;God's Children&quot; was issued as a single (b/w either &quot;Moments&quot; or &quot;The Way Love Used to Be&quot;, depending on the country) in April 1971. In the UK a 4-track EP was also released featuring &quot;God's Children&quot;, &quot;The Way Love Used To Be&quot;, &quot;Moments&quot; and &quot;Dreams&quot;. This was the Kinks' last release with Pye while they were still under contract. Unlike the album, the single was released in the US (in July) but failed to chart there or in the UK. It was a minor hit in Australia (reaching #53) and New Zealand (#21). In the US the tracks &quot;God's Children&quot; and &quot;Willesden Green&quot; were included on The Kink Kronikles compilation in 1972. &quot;The Way Love Used to Be&quot; was included on 1973's The Great Lost Kinks Album.\n\n&quot;Willesden Green&quot; is the only released song by the Kinks to feature lead vocals by another band member other than the Davies brothers. Bassist John Dalton sings lead vocals on the track, doing an impression of Elvis Presley.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\nDeluxe Edition [Tracks 14-23 are bonus tracks]\n\n01. \t&quot;God's Children&quot;   \t3:16\n02. \t&quot;Lola&quot; (instrumental blues jam version) \t4:46\n03. \t&quot;The Way Love Used to Be&quot;   \t2:15\n04. \t&quot;Completely&quot; (instrumental) \t3:41\n05. \t&quot;Running Round Town&quot; (instrumental) \t1:06\n06. \t&quot;Moments&quot;   \t2:57\n07. \t&quot;Animals In The Zoo&quot;   \t2:22\n08. \t&quot;Just Friends&quot;   \t2:38\n09. \t&quot;Whip Lady&quot; (instrumental) \t1:20\n10. \t&quot;Dreams&quot;   \t3:45\n11. \t&quot;Helga&quot; (instrumental) \t1:57\n12. \t&quot;Willesden Green&quot;   \t2:27\n13. \t&quot;God's Children - End&quot; (instrumental) \t0:29\n14. \t&quot;Dreams&quot; (remix) \t3:24\n15. \t&quot;Lola&quot; (1970 mono single mix) \t4:06\n16. \t&quot;Apeman&quot; (1970 mono single mix) \t3:53\n17. \t&quot;Rats&quot; (1970 mono single mix) \t2:42\n18. \t&quot;Powerman&quot; (mono mix) \t4:26\n19. \t&quot;The Moneygoround&quot; (mono alternative version) \t1:41\n20. \t&quot;Apeman&quot; (mono alternative version) \t3:41\n21. \t&quot;God's Children&quot; (mono film mix) \t3:18\n22. \t&quot;The Way Love Used to Be&quot; (mono film mix) \t2:07\n23. \t&quot;God's Children - End&quot; (mono film mix) \t0:50","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e83810d26c093d7259a5322bc2f04f8c36435043","amp;dn":"The+Kinks+-+Percy+%5BDeluxe%5D+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e83810d26c093d7259a5322bc2f04f8c36435043","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,56,16,210,108,9,61,114,89,165,50,43,194,240,79,140,54,67,80,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
