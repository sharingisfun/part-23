Mastermind Bill Leeb, along with Jeremy Inkel, Jared Slingerland, Craig Johnsen, and Sasha Keevill have created a concussive, driving opus. Completely guitar free, the new album relies entirely on electronics. The opening chords of the seething Resonance sets the tone of the album, and segues perfectly into the complex percussion of Leveled and the anthemic dance track Killing Grounds. Tracks such as Ghosts and the title track show the band willing to push past the boundaries between modern electronica and electro-industrial. Overall, Echogenetic shows Front Line Assembly is in top form, and continues to be a leading force in the electronic music scene.\n\nTracklist:\n\n01. Resonance\n02. Leveled\n03. Killing Grounds\n04.
