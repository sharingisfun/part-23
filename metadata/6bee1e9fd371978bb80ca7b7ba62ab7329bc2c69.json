But the public spotlight made him uneasy. In 1944, as he considered the personal impact of his prosperity, Steinbeck began The Pearl. Reworking an ancient legend, Steinbeck created a powerful parable of modern manÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s preoccupation with materialism, money, and power. The story is of Keno, a poor fisherman who finds a great, luminous pearl. Although he is sure the fortune it represents will solve all his problems, Keno eventually realizes that the pearl has marked his life forever. The Pearl is a moving tragedy, written in language that is simple yet eloquent. Narrator Frank Muller adds a dramatic intensity and urgency to this timeless work from one of the greatest authors of the 20th century.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6bee1e9fd371978bb80ca7b7ba62ab7329bc2c69","amp;dn":"THE+PEARL+-+John+Steinbeck.+Read+by+Frank+Muller+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6bee1e9fd371978bb80ca7b7ba62ab7329bc2c69","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,238,30,159,211,113,151,139,184,12,167,183,186,98,171,115,41,188,44,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
