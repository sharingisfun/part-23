The 'Dirty Harry' of bag ladies. She uses her old age, alleged senility, physical and mental decrepitude by dressing in old clothes (a long muddy jacket, dirty apron, a cap - pulled down, crumpled and patched, a dress which gives an air of witches), so as to not pay the bill in bars, tear the books in the library with impunity and in general enjoy the mercy of her neighbors with a cunning maliciousness and despicable insight. Living in total isolation from the rest of society, she hates mankind, and symbolizes the grumpy tranquility of France in her time.\n\n\nI translated that description from French, which is (admittedly) not a strength. The short of it is that this is one of the best things Renegade Press ever published, and they published a lot of great stuff in during their short lifespan. The art is great, with a beautiful use of empty space balanced against the detailed line work and wonderfully expressive caricature like faces. And the translated text, done by the great Lofficiers, is sharp, quick witted and funny.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:71a46fd719b62b8714d542d109802a0a1395febc","amp;dn":"French+Ice+featuring+Carmen+Cru","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"71a46fd719b62b8714d542d109802a0a1395febc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,164,111,215,25,182,43,135,20,213,66,209,9,128,42,10,19,149,254,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
