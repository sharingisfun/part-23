And each will captain their negation and ridicule before eventually, on the third day, falling into some kind of teary and blissful acceptance.\n\nThis is a story of happiness, regardless of the hurt and suffering of which it is sometimes garbed.\n\nwww.cseanmcgee.com\n\nTheFreeArtCollection\n\nComing Soon:\n\nThe Time Traveler's Wife\n\nRock Book Volume III: Still Life\n\nThrough The Multiverse\n\nTake Risk and Take Care,\n\nC.SeanMcGee","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1750a9adb35777d91e8cf047f0e7eab97d9d8c41","amp;dn":"Happy+People+Live+Here+%28iPad3%29+by+C.SeanMcGee","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1750a9adb35777d91e8cf047f0e7eab97d9d8c41","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,80,169,173,179,87,119,217,30,140,240,71,240,231,234,185,125,157,140,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
