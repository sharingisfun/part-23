There are apparently bootleg\nCDs out there containing badly mistimed or mispitched music. There may\nalso be conductors who&amp;#039;re orchestrating his score at the wrong speed.\n...I dunno; I just know that the stuff I&amp;#039;ve heard so far sounds rotten.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:013d6e7a7d5f6d4aa60b72d114c1ffb4d9d7be19","amp;dn":"El+Cid+1961+Miriam+Restored+Honeyko+XviD+100%25+Restored+ESP-sub+C","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"013d6e7a7d5f6d4aa60b72d114c1ffb4d9d7be19","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,61,110,122,125,95,109,74,166,11,114,209,20,193,255,180,217,215,190,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
