The character first appeared in The Incredible Hulk #1 (May 1962), and was created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. After physicist Dr. Robert Bruce Banner was caught in the blast of a gamma bomb he created, he was transformed into the Hulk, a giant, raging monster. The character, both as Banner and the Hulk, is frequently pursued by the police or the armed forces, often as a result of the destruction he causes. While the coloration of the character&amp;#039;s skin varies during the course of its publication history, the Hulk is most often depicted as green.
