She's quiet, keeps to herself, and doesn't get out much. Not because she's not pretty. She is. It's just that, well, Sookie has this sort of &quot;disability.&quot; She can read minds. And that doesn't make her too dateable. And then along comes Bill. He's tall, dark, handsome -- and Sookie can't hear a word he's thinking. He's exactly the kind of guy she's been waiting for all her life.\n\nBut Bill has a disability of his own: he's a vampire with a bad reputation. He hangs out with a seriously creepy crowd, all suspected of -- big surprise -- murder. And when one of Sookie's co-workers is killed, she fears she's next.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0af84a89028a8e85b127be4ef50a49bde5fff9d7","amp;dn":"Dead+Until+Dark+-+Charlaine+Harris-viny","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0af84a89028a8e85b127be4ef50a49bde5fff9d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,248,74,137,2,138,142,133,177,39,190,78,245,10,73,189,229,255,249,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
