Sadly, Aslan imploded in 1988 on the very day their debut single was due to be released stateside, but regrouped half a decade later and forged a legacy that has seen them become one of Ireland's most popular and enduring acts. Inspired by David Bowie, the Smiths, and the Rolling Stones, Aslan crashed onto the Irish music scene in 1986 with the release of debut single &quot;This Is,&quot; an entirely self-funded effort that earned them a record deal with EMI Ireland and would go on to become the longest playlisted track in the history of Irish radio. Following their mid-'90s re-formation, Aslan's music became softer and more melodically mature, evoking the Beatles, Stevie Wonder, and contemporaries Oasis, and their domestic profile continued to rise through the '90s, establishing them as one of the country's most successful touring acts.\n\n(font: allmusic)\n\n320 kbps\n44,1 KHz\n16 bit\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ae08100c0d8e8282a94e2695cd92170950d7ac9","amp;dn":"Aslan+-+The+Platinum+Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ae08100c0d8e8282a94e2695cd92170950d7ac9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,224,129,0,192,216,232,40,42,148,226,105,92,217,33,112,149,13,122,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
