There is no any software or updates added except newer Internet Explorer 9. Windows 7 is not activated (you can use your own key or favourite method of activation). Some tools used: dism, gimagex, vLite, RT7lite, W7T etc. (many thanks to their autors)\n\nSome features left are:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nWindows Media Player (with default codecs)\nInternet Explorer 9 (Google is default search engine and home page)\nWindows Mail (working)\nWindows Fax and Scan\nWindows Defender (on by default)\nWinSAT (Windows Experience Index tool)\nall components needed for mobile computers\nGadgets (CPU/RAM usage, time, calendar)\nGames (no premium games)\n.NET Framework 3.5.1\nWindows Update and Security Center\n\nA lot of stuff is removed to reduce the size of the image (fits on single CD).\nSome tweaks are applied:\n------------------------\nAllow 3rd Party Themes\nAllow Windows Live Movie to import from network\nAlways Unload DLL\nDisable Group Policy Synchronise\nDisable Hibernation\nDisable Search Online on Unknown File Extensions\nDisable Shortcut Link Resolve\nDisable Thumbnail Cache\nDisable Windows Error Reporting\nDouble Mouse Speed\nEnable Boot Defrag\nEnable DVD in Media Player\nEnable MSI Service in Safe Mode\nFaster Browsing in IE\nIncrease Icon Cache\nKill Services Quicker on Shutdown\nOpen NFO files with notepad\nRemove 'HomeGroup' from Explorer\nRemove 'Libraries' from Explorer\nRemove 'Music' from Start Menu\nRemove 'Pictures' from Start Menu\nRemove Shortcut Suffix\nRemove 'Videos' from Start Menu\nRemove Windows Mail Splash\nRestore Previous Folder at Logon\nShow 'Computer' on Desktop\nShow Hidden Files/Folders\nSpeed-up Access to AVI Media Files\nUnlimited Simultaneous Downloads\n\nSome services startup is modified as well (see screenshots).\n\nNote that almost all the drivers are removed and you should have your computer drivers ready before installation (at least drivers needed for network devices).\nDrivers left:\n-------------\nBasic system drivers\nSound drivers\nLAN/WLAN drivers\n\nSome removed features:\n----------------------\nAccessibility\nBitLocker\nPowerShell\nWindows Help\nasian languages and fonts (MS Office 2010 installs without errors)\nSome rarely used fonts\nSpeech engine\nTablet features\nIIS\nRemote Desktop and Assistance\nSync Center\nWindows Sounds, themes (aero presents)\nWindows Easy Transfer\n\nIf you are regular user you will not notice any difference using my lite version compared to full-featured Windows 7.\nI spent more than 200 hours in process of manipulation wim images and testing them. Finally I finished my task (a reliable image with CD size and maximum number of features left) and can share with you what I've done. Now I'm pretty happy using and sharing my built-up Windows 7.\n\nAn autoattended.xml file is inserted in the image to automate the installation (Language: EN, name: Administrator, PC name: IK-PC, time: UTC+3h. All can be changed after setup). You need only to point a partition for installation and in 5-10 min Windows should be installed.\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nBurn the ISO to a CD &amp; use it as a boot disc...\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n*** When using TPB please read these important notes: \n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n01. AV software may warn about keygens, patches, cracks etc because of their \n    capabilities and signatures (generating codes, etc). Sometimes also they're \n    added to the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If not \n    trusting keygens, patches, cracks etc don't use them.\n\n02. To avoid AV software removing/blocking clean cracks etc: exclude the crack \n    or folder from being auto-protected &amp; auto-scanned by the AV software.\n\n03. If AV software removed a clean crack usually it can be restored \n    (if it's not in Quarantine then look at History or something similar).\n\n04. To avoid risks when using cracks also Sandboxie can be used to test them:\n   &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.sandboxie.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.sandboxie.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n   &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6487418&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6487418&lt;/a&gt;\n\n05. Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks etc always check first \n    if they can be unpacked. Often some thirth party added a virus to the \n    original file, repacked it, and uploaded it again.\n\n06. Letting AV software software sending scan results to their companies \n    can cause keygens, patches, cracks etc being added to their virus-database.\n\n07. Firewalls which are set to automatically decide for connections will allow \n    connections for lots of apps &amp; MALWARE!. To avoid so firewalls should be set \n    to decide yourself which connection to allow or not.\n\n08. Clicking on unknown links can coz malware being silently installed on a pc!\n\n09. Usually (new) torrents with extreme many downloads &amp; seeders in a short time \n    are very suspicious! Torrents with a SKULL-logo are trusted.\n\n10. Some (frustrated) people use multiple accounts and post lots of FAKE comments \n    and/or files trying to spread confusion. Usually they NEVER seriously reply \n    on comments and don't have any torrent, or to look reliable just a few.\n\n11. In general often there are more fake &amp; negative comments than reliable &amp; \n    positive comments.\n\n12. In some countries uploading/downloading copyright-protected material is \n    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable uploaders is not.\n\n13. Posting FAKE comments &amp; uploads on TPB can result in getting banned from TPB!\n\n14. Comments are welcome, unlike ranting, trolling, whining, etc.\n\n15. No Promises ... No Debts!\n\n\nFor reporting bad or suspicious torrents:                                            &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor requests:                                           &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=31&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=31&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor visiting my 1100+ torrents:                                            &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/Anacondaz/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/Anacondaz/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nTo the &quot;United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users&quot;,\n\nNowadays a lot of TPB members abuse their TPB membership by intentionally \nposting fake comments &amp; files. Their meaning is just trying to spread \nconfusion and to frustrate TPB and it's users. \nLess downloaders = less seeders = less download speed etc = not good! \n\nIt's in the benefit of TPB and all reliable users to warn each other about people \nwho intentionally keep posting fake comments &amp; files. It's an easy answer against \nthose who intentionally keep posting fake comments &amp; files, which is a never \nending issue. \n\nWhen reporting errors or false positives just keep in mind that what goes up for \none does not always goes up for another. That's for both the working of an app \nand about false positives! Remember: whatever is said, say it constructive! \nLet's just try to help each other and TPB by thinking about what's said &amp; posted. \nThings are all up to you, the &quot;United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users&quot;!\n\n\nEnjoy The Pirate Bay\t\t\n\t\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:82f03c69ee8e206122076a39271dcf35e9941ad9","amp;dn":"Windows+7+Ultimate+SP1+32-bit+Lite-IK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"82f03c69ee8e206122076a39271dcf35e9941ad9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,240,60,105,238,142,32,97,34,7,106,57,39,29,207,53,233,148,26,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
