Still  only\nin  his  thirties,  and  with  a string  of  starring  and  supporting\nroles, he  has portrayed  contemporary icons, historical  figures, and\nfictional  favorites,  from  Stephen  Hawking,  to  William  Pitt  the\nYounger, to Frankenstein.  But inevitably, he is still  best known for\nhis  idiosyncratic and  boldly  21st century  incarnation of  Sherlock\nHolmes in the BBC TV series,  Sherlock. The Sherlock starÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s story is a\ngenuinely compelling addition to a  sometimes anodyne genre. This book\nwill trace everything from his travels in Tibet to the trauma of being\nkidnapped at  gun-point in South  Africa. His eventful  personal life,\nstellar acting career,  and the witty, self-effacing  interviews he is\nrenowned for  are sure to make  him a perfect subject  for an in-depth\nbiography.\n\n\nAuthor\n======\nJustin  Lewis  has  been   writing  about  entertainment,  music,  and\nbroadcasting for more than 25 years. As well as writing biographies on\nfigures ranging  from the actor Andy  Serkis to popÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Gary  Barlow, he\nhas contributed to more than 50 publications, including Guinness World\nRecords, No Known Cure, and The Rough Guide to Rock.\n\n-_-\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f3a6ac20b465b3a969ed95020ba7ec019945c52","amp;dn":"Benedict+Cumberbatch%3A+The+Biography+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f3a6ac20b465b3a969ed95020ba7ec019945c52","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,58,106,194,11,70,91,58,150,158,217,80,32,186,126,192,25,148,92,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
