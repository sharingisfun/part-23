The guitarist leads his rhythm section (John Truscinski on drums and Justin Tripp on bass) through a set of tunes that nod in the direction of the Grateful Dead, JJ Cale, and Neil Young without feeling remotely retro. The interplay here is marvelous; Truscinksi and Tripp can choogle like nobodyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s business, but with the lightness and dynamics of jazz players, leaving Gunn free to weave intricate webs of layered acoustic and electric guitars. The album rocks, to be sure, but never relies on volume for its inherent heaviness. Dig the beautiful ebb and flow of its majestic opener, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Water Wheel,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the deep boogie of Ã¢â‚¬Å“New Decline,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ or the hypnotic churn of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Trailways Rambler.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Time Off captures a musician at the top of his game. GunnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s aim is true.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:20e8044e9c6e531d8655a5187134196956d32c9e","amp;dn":"Steve+Gunn+-+Time+Off+%5B2013%5D%5BFLAC%2FWEB%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"20e8044e9c6e531d8655a5187134196956d32c9e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,232,4,78,156,110,83,29,134,85,165,24,113,52,25,105,86,211,44,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
