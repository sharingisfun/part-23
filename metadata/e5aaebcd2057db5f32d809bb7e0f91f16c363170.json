However, Mascis does not play guitar for the band; he plays his first instrument, the drums. To complete the band's line-up, Mascis and Sweetapple recruited the guitarist and vocalist, Kyle Thomas, from King Tuff and avant-folk group Feathers. Their eponymous debut album was released on March 7, 2006. They also contributed an alternate version of the song &quot;Rip Van Winkle&quot; to the Invaders compilation, which was released by Kemado Records later that year. Their latest album Paralyzed was released on March 18, 2008.\nStyle\n\nWitch's trademark sound (particularly in their early work) shows obvious Black Sabbath influence. Black Flag influence was also noted for their sophomore effort, Paralyzed.\nInfluences\n\nWitch's various members have many influences that have given them their trademark style. They include The Wipers, Dead Meadow, and Black Sabbath.[1]\nBand members\n\n    Kyle Thomas - vocals, guitar\n    Graham Clise - guitar\n    Dave Sweetapple - bass\n    J Mascis - drums\n    Antoine, Kyle's friend toured with them in Europe\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e5aaebcd2057db5f32d809bb7e0f91f16c363170","amp;dn":"Witch+-+Witch++MP3++320k++ak2014","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e5aaebcd2057db5f32d809bb7e0f91f16c363170","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,170,235,205,32,87,219,95,50,216,9,187,126,15,145,241,108,54,49,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
