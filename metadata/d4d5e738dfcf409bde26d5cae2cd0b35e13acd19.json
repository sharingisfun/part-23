His work has been influenced by Electro artists like Kraftwerk, New Wave artists such as The Cure and Depeche Mode, as well as the French rave scene of the early 1990s. In the mid 1990s, The Hacker began producing electro-pop with his friend, Caroline HervÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© (aka Miss Kittin). They were soon signed to the Gigolo label in 1997. The Hacker is also a well sought-after producer, and has done remixes for Marc Almond, Fischerspooner, Air, and Nitzer Ebb. He released 2 full studio albums so far.\n\nTracklist\n\n01. Sequence\n02.

The DVD is crammed with goodies, two hours worth of footage in fact, including a documentary feature in addition to various live documents: there's an entire live set recorded in Grenoble back in 2006, plus extra live footage from 2002 featuring Miss Kittin. The hour-long feature 'X' is particularly interesting, documenting The Hacker's beginnings in Grenoble and charting his career arc with more live footage in addition to interviews with the likes of DJ Hell.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d4d5e738dfcf409bde26d5cae2cd0b35e13acd19","amp;dn":"The+Hacker","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d4d5e738dfcf409bde26d5cae2cd0b35e13acd19","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,213,231,56,223,207,64,155,222,38,213,202,226,205,11,53,225,58,205,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
