This book attempts to answer the skeptic's questions and in that sense it is apologetic, however, it also seeks to inspire the reader to take some first steps on a walk of faith. Christians will find it an invaluable tool for personal evangelism and encouragement, and enquirers a challenge to take the story of salvation seriously. Just Christianity was first written in the 1990's as a series of long letters. They were sent discretely to a man who was reluctant to discuss Christianity openly. He was dying of cancer. The letters answered many of his questions and doubts, and challenged him to accept the gospel message. He gave his life to Christ in his eleventh hour, a few days before he went to meet his Lord and Saviour face to face. This book is dedicated to the memory of him and his wife.[/color]\n\n[color=purple]IF YOU LIKE IT THEN SAY THANK YOU.:):)\nPLEASE CONTINUE TO SEED AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE.THANK YOU:)[/color]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:98be1d4a80b735940151382fb619021aaac32506","amp;dn":"Just-Christianity-The-Story-of-Salvation-for-Adults+%7BZ00Z33%7D%7Bepu","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"98be1d4a80b735940151382fb619021aaac32506","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,190,29,74,128,183,53,148,1,81,56,47,182,25,2,26,170,195,37,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
