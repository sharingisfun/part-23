Ses textes en arabe, franÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§ais et en anglais et ses rythmes trÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨s mÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©tissÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©s (ChaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢bi, gnawa, rock, reggae...) explorent la richesse musicale de l'Afrique du Nord.\n\n\n===============================================================================\n\n\nGnawa Diffusion is a Gnawa music band based in Grenoble in France. The group's lead singer, Amazigh (literally meaning 'Kabyle' in that language), is the son of the Algerian writer and poet Kateb Yacine. Although there is a strong Gnawa influence, the band is noted for its mix of reggae and roots music. It must be pointed out that the band members are mixed French and Algerian and possibly of other roots.\n\nThis is a list of the members of the band:\n\nAmazigh Kateb : vocal and gimbri\nMohamed Abdenour : mandolin, banjo, kerkab, choir\nPierre Bonnet : bass\nPhilippe Bonnet : drums\nSalah Meguiba : Keyboard, oriental percussion , choir\nPierre Feugier : guitar, choir, karkabs\nAbdel Aziz Maysour\nAmar Chaoui : percussionist, choir\nGnawa Diffusion is quite popular in France and very popular in Algeria.\n\nThe band's lyrics are in Arabic, Berber, French and English. \n\nThe lead singer's lyrics are often controversial. Themes range from discussions of poverty in his native Algeria or corruption in government to denunciations of global military actions and perceived imperialism. Nevertheless, in spite of a strong political direction, this band also has more entrancing numbers which focus on self-determination and improvement.\n\n\n-------\nAlbums: \n\n1997: Algeria\n1999: Bab El Oued Kingston\n2000: DZ Live &quot;Alger&quot;\n2004: Souk System\n2007: Fucking Cowboys (live in Paris)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ddc0187ea5676d6a540a2822d02a34c0b8170e4a","amp;dn":"Gnawa+Diffusion+-+5+albums","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ddc0187ea5676d6a540a2822d02a34c0b8170e4a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,192,24,126,165,103,109,106,84,10,40,34,208,42,52,192,184,23,14,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
