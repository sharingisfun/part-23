His recipes for great salads, sweet and savoury bakes, soups and wonderful sharing plates are highly original, but really simple to create at home, and with American food writer Laura Washburn Hutton he shares 100 of his most memorable recipes. Chris writes: 'What this book will offer the reader is an education in balancing taste and texture, with plenty of visual inspiration. It is as much guidebook as cookery book because I don't necessarily think in terms of recipes, I think in terms of combinations. Mix up the flavours and textures and, at the same time, make it appeal to the eye. Be generous, make it unpredictable  this is what I do. My book will teach the reader to do this too.'","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:46833457a6b9fc7b3a12afce2e8d56fa0018a4c2","amp;dn":"Chriskitch%3A+Big+Flavours+From+A+Small+Kitchen+-+Chris+Honor+%28epu","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"46833457a6b9fc7b3a12afce2e8d56fa0018a4c2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,131,52,87,166,185,252,123,58,18,175,206,46,141,86,250,0,24,164,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
