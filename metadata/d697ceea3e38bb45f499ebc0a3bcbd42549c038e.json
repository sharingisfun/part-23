As the average household level of consumption rises, so does the astronomical amount of waste we collectively create. Are we turning the earth into one giant garbage can? Determined to understand the damage we are doing, Nisker enlists the average urban family, the McDonalds, to keep every scrap of garbage that they produce for three months in their increasingly smelly garage. From organic waste to dirty diapers, from plastic bottles to Christmas wrapping, the McDonald&amp;#039;s discover that for every action there is a reaction that affects them and the entire planet. At turns hilarious, provocative, and alarming, Garbage! The Revolution Starts at Home will change the way you think about the garbage sitting out on your curb and will make you think twice before you eat on paper plates.\n-Alan Black ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d697ceea3e38bb45f499ebc0a3bcbd42549c038e","amp;dn":"Garbage+The+Revolution+Starts+At+Home","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d697ceea3e38bb45f499ebc0a3bcbd42549c038e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,151,206,234,62,56,187,69,244,153,235,192,163,188,189,66,84,156,3,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
