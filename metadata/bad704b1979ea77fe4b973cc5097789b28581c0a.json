Paul Bell played his beautiful National Steel resonator guitar, Johnny Castle thumped his Clevenger upright bass, Pete Ragusa used brushes on a parade snare drum and Mark Wenner blasted away on his custom-tuned Hohner harmonicas without a mic! Although many of the tunes have been on previous Nighthawks recordings, we never played them like this. The selections lean bluesy, with several Muddy Waters classics plus Little Walter and Sonny Boy, along with Bo Diddley, Chuck Berry and James Brown. \n\n\n\n1. The Chicken and the Hawk[4:58] \n2.
