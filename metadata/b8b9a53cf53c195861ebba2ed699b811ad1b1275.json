I found so many new artists and albums which I wouldn&amp;#039;t have found without OiNK. I made also a new record of buying albums in the present year, spent nearly all my money, more than 1000EUR in music that I had found on OiNK.\nFrom now on I will buy more other things and less music because it&amp;#039;s just against my conscience to support organization that destroyed one of the greatest cultural archives of all time.
