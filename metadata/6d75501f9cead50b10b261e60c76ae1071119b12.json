Previously the members of the Ladypops, Karina's and Colt 45, they performed under the names Alice May and Caren Wood. Taking inspiration from ABBA and such fellow Dutch acts as Pussycat and Teach-In, dark-haired Caren (lead vocals) and blonde Alice (songwriter/backing vocals) broke into the Europop scene with the single &quot;You Treated Me Wrong&quot; in December of 1979. They hit the Netherlands' number one with &quot;Late at Night&quot; in June of 1980, and they had two more Top Five successes with &quot;Give Me Back My Love&quot; (September of 1980) and &quot;Rio&quot; (July of 1981.) Maywood's records were sold in 52 countries and it received awards at music festivals in Germany, Poland, Japan and South Korea. The duo's popularity in Latin America prompted the sisters to record an album with Spanish-language covers of their hits\n\n\nTrack Listing (MP3, 256kbps)\n\n1\tYou And I\n2\tThis Broken Heart\n3\tMother, How Are You Today\n4\tGive Me Something\n5\tBlue Sunday Morning\n6\tLate At Night\n7\tYou're Making Me Crazy\n8\tGive Me Back My Love\n9\tCan I Hold You\n10\tRio\n11\tLosing You\n12\tLving Up To Expectations\n\n\nSCANNED WITH ESET SMART SECURITY: NO THREATS OR INFECTIONS\n\nPLEASE SEED !!
