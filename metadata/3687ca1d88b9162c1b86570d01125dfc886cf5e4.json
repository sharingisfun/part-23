It was the last of two studio albums to feature drummer Jimmy DeGrasso as well as the only one to feature Al Pitrelli on lead guitar. It was the last album to feature original bassist Dave Ellefson until his return to Megadeth in 2010 and the following album, Thirteen. The World Needs a Hero is the first Megadeth album since 1990's Rust in Peace to feature band mascot Vic Rattlehead on the front cover. Edited versions of the album put an adhesive bandage over the innards of Dave Mustaine from which Vic Rattlehead is seen emerging.\n\nFormat                                   : MPEG Audio\nFile size                                : 82.9 MiB\nDuration                                 : 57 min\nOverall bit rate mode                    : Constant\nOverall bit rate                         : 192 Kbps\nAlbum                                    : The World Needs A Hero\nAlbum/Performer                          : Megadeth\nPerformer                                : Megadeth\nComposer                                 : Dave Mustaine\nPublisher                                : Sanctuary\nGenre                                    : Trash Metal\nRecorded date                            : 2001\nWriting library                          : LAME3.91\nCover                                    : Yes\nCover type                               : Cover (front)\nCover MIME                               : image/jpeg\n\nAudio\nFormat                                   : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                           : Version 1\nFormat profile                           : Layer 3\nBit rate mode                            : Constant\nBit rate                                 : 192 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nSampling rate                            : 44.1 KHz\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\nStream size                              : 7.33 MiB (98%)\nWriting library                          : LAME3.91","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3687ca1d88b9162c1b86570d01125dfc886cf5e4","amp;dn":"%5B2001%5D+Megadeth+-+The+world+needs+a+hero","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3687ca1d88b9162c1b86570d01125dfc886cf5e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,135,202,29,136,185,22,44,27,134,87,13,1,18,93,252,136,108,245,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
