It was a four-week 1969 number-one hit single by fictional characters The Archies. Produced by Jeff Barry, the song was originally released on the album Everything's Archie. The album is the product of a group of studio musicians managed by Don Kirshner. Ron Dante's lead vocals were accompanied by those of Toni Wine (who sang the line &quot;I'm gonna make your life so sweet&quot;), Andy Kim, and Ellie Greenwich. Together, they provided the voices of the various Archies using multitracking. Ray Stevens, the comic singer, provided the hand claps to the song. \nThe ArchieÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s &quot;Sugar, Sugar&quot; was the 1969 number one single of the year. According to Billboard magazine, this is a feat yet to be duplicated by any other fictional band. It spent four weeks at the top of the Billboard Hot 100 from September 20, 1969 and eight weeks at the top of the UK singles chart. The song lists at #63 on Billboard's Greatest Songs of All Time.On February 5, 2006, &quot;Sugar, Sugar&quot; was inducted into the Canadian Songwriters Hall of Fame, as co-writer Andy Kim is originally from Montreal, Quebec.\n&quot;Sugar, Sugar&quot; is considered the canonical example of the bubblegum pop musical genre.
