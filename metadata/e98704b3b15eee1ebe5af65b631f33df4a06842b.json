In recent years, it has come to play an \never more important role in the theory of computing. It is studied in many \ndisciplines, including process theory and concurrency, modal logic and \nautomata theory. Typically, coinductive proofs demonstrate the equivalence of \ntwo objects by constructing a suitable bisimulation relation between them. \nThis collection of surveys is aimed at both researchers and Master's students \nin computer science and mathematics and deals with various aspects of \nbisimulation and coinduction, with an emphasis on process theory. Seven \nchapters cover the following topics: history, algebra and coalgebra, \nalgorithmics, logic, higher-order languages, enhancements of the bisimulation \nproof method, and probabilities. Exercises are also included to help the reader \nmaster new material.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e98704b3b15eee1ebe5af65b631f33df4a06842b","amp;dn":"CAMBRIDGE+UNIVERSITY+PRESS+ADVANCED+TOPICS+IN+BISIMULATION+AND+C","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e98704b3b15eee1ebe5af65b631f33df4a06842b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,135,4,179,177,94,238,30,190,90,246,91,99,31,51,223,74,6,132,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
