A feature that is fundamental to both is the dynamic aspects of the vascular system. Although the basic principles governing blood flow and the circulatory function are known, new approaches to examining the interaction of different parts of the vascular system have emerged. These include measurement techniques and quantitative methods with greater use of modern technology and computer modeling. An obvious need therefore exists for a book that deals specifically with the dynamics of the vascular system. This book begins with the historical discoveries of the features of the vascular system and its importance in the overall circulatory function. Modern aspects of vascular biology in terms of structure and function are then described, followed by the introduction of physical principles and basic fluid mechanics for quantitative analysis. The hemodynamics of large arteries, the optimal structure of vascular branching and the pulsatile energy transmission and modeling aspects are elaborated. These are extended to analyze the function of the venous system and the microcirculation. Finally, the integrated vascular system and its response and adaptation to diseased conditions, such as aging, stenosis, hypertension, myocardial ischemia, atheroslerosis and stroke are explained. The overall emphasis is on the dynamic nature of the vascular system","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f685bbcbb311b1aae2f8109765761290f361740","amp;dn":"Dynamics+of+the+Vascular+System","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f685bbcbb311b1aae2f8109765761290f361740","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,104,91,188,187,49,27,26,174,47,129,9,118,87,97,41,15,54,23,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
