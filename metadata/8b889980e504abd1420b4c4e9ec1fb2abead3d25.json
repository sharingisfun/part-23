Drawn from Copeland's first four Rounder releases, the material is, for the most part, straightforward electric blues, showcasing Copeland's passionate, raw-throated vocals and prodigious talents as an axe-slinger. On all of these sessions, Copeland is backed by an energetic band, with lots of horns adding fat, brash punctuation. Special guests also dot the personnel list, including avant-garde jazz saxophonist Arthur Blythe, who plays a solo on &quot;Copeland Special,&quot; and fellow Texas guitar legend Stevie Ray Vaughan, who has a blistering spot on &quot;Don't Stop By the Creek, Son.&quot;\n\nIn addition to fine servings of traditional down-home blues from Copeland's initial three Rounder releases, all of which showcase his stinging, superbly executed leads, Texas Twister includes three cuts from BringinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ It All Back Hom, an album Copeland recorded in Africa. Unlike anything else recorded in the blues idiom, these tracks superimpose blues licks from the American South over a rich web of African percussion and Afro-pop textures. These tracks offer a pleasant and intriguing contrast to the more conventional blues fare featured, and suggest that Copeland had a flair for experimentation in addition to his mastery of traditional electric blues.\n\nTracklist\n1.
