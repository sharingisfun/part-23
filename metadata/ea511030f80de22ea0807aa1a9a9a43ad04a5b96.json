All My Rage\n\nBritish singer-songwriter Laura Marling announced her long-anticipated third lp, A Creature I DonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Know, a couple of weeks ago and earlier this week she shared the album details for the record. A Creature I DonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Know will be released on September 13 via Virgin Records and itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll be produced by Ethan Johns, and you can view the tracklist below and album cover above.\n\nMarlingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s image seems to change slightly with every record, from callow youth to brunette ingenue and now world-wearied and wised up. Her voice has aged and grown richer with her, the more lived-in vocal of I Speak Because I Can now developing into something earthier and far, far beyond her years (not too far past 21). With maturity comes great responsibility towards your songwriting, and on first listen thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s something sheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s capable too of facing up to. As with the last album it was recorded in a room by Ethan Johns, meaning it develops as it goes not in the heavy-handed Mumfords crescendo sense but steadily growing strings, multi-tracked backing vocals and Marling coming to terms with her emotions. Three minutes it breaks into a trot of west coast folk-rock of a thankfully restrained hue and then weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re talking, not to mention looking forward to SeptemberÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s A Creature I DonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Know.\n\nLaura MarlingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s third lp was originally scheduled for release last year, but the touring in support of her second album I Speak Because I Can which was released last year came in the way. Her third record will be called A Creature I DonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Know and while the title has been known for a while today the album was officially announced with a September release scheduled ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ according to The Line Of Best Fit the exact release date will be September 12 and the album will be released on Virgin Records. Considering the sheer quality of I Speak Because I Can and the excellent album preview which was released today IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m beyond excited about this, especially considering that Ethan Johns is producing it.\n\nThe track Sophia:\n\nThe delicate opening chords and the lyrics, which speak of a loverÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s betrayal and the aftermath of an unfulfilling one night stand (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWhoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s been touching my skin?/ Who have I been letting in?/ Shy and tired eyed am I todayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½) sound bound up in the same rum, post-coital world of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“I Speak Because I CanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢. But very quickly, the track grows wings and flies out of the shadowy hinterlands of that album. Electric guitars, a string quartet and multi-tracked Lauras swoop in, suggesting a new sturdiness and defiance in the singerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s outlook.\n\nSoon after the track mutates into a kind of country-rock anthem. Jangly guitars hip-pop next to each other, whilst MarlingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s harmonies shimmer Linda Ronstadt-like all the while intoning the name of the songÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s heroine.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2011/08/14/laura-marling/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2011/08/14/laura-marling/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea511030f80de22ea0807aa1a9a9a43ad04a5b96","amp;dn":"Laura+Marling...A+Creature+I+Don%5C%27t+Know%282011%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea511030f80de22ea0807aa1a9a9a43ad04a5b96","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,81,16,48,248,13,226,46,160,128,122,161,169,169,164,58,208,74,91,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
