During 1930s he worked as an entertainer on board transatlantic liners on the routes between Europe and North America, which gave him the opportunity to get to know American music genres, especially jazz and swing.\n\nIn 1935 he was hired by an Italian-American radio station in New York. Back in Italy in 1937, Otto presented an innovative repertoire, strongly influenced by American music of that era. But he had to face Italian Fascist regime censorship, that banned anything foreign. He was forced to translate song titles and lyrics into Italian. The Italian state radio company EIAR did not broadcast his songs, and labelled them as &quot;barbaric negro antimusic&quot;.\n\nBanned from the radio, Natalino Otto worked for recording companies instead, together with two great Italian bandleaders such as Gorni Kramer and Pippo Barzizza. In a short while he won the audience with his records - one of the few Italian singers of those times, if not the only one, to achieve success without his songs playing on the radio. Italian people danced to his swing tunes, which earned him the nickname &quot;King of Rhythm&quot;.\n\n.: Cover :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img853.imageshack.us/img853/8058/natalinootto.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img853.imageshack.us/img853/8058/natalinootto.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.: TrackList :.\n\n01-Che ritmo, senti che ritmo.mp3\n02-Ho un sassolino nella scarpa.mp3\n03-No jazz.mp3\n04-In cerca di te (solo se me ne vo...).mp3\n05-Polvere di stelle (Stardust).mp3\n06-Ho comprato un piano elettrico.mp3\n07-Da te era bello restar!.mp3\n08-Hey!
