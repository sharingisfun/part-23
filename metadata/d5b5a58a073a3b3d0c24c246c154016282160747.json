There he learns of greedy corporate figurehead Parker Selfridge's intentions of driving off the native humanoid &quot;Na'vi&quot; in order to mine for the precious material scattered throughout their rich woodland. In exchange for the spinal surgery that will fix his legs, Jake gathers intel for the cooperating military unit spearheaded by gung-ho Colonel Quaritch, while simultaneously attempting to infiltrate the Na'vi people with the use of an &quot;avatar&quot; identity. While Jake begins to bond with the native tribe and quickly falls in love with the beautiful alien Neytiri, the restless Colonel moves forward with his ruthless extermination tactics, forcing the soldier to take a stand - and fight back in an epic battle for the fate of Pandora. In the future, Jake, a paraplegic war veteran, is brought to another planet, Pandora, which is inhabited by the Na'vi, a humanoid race with their own language and culture. Those from Earth find themselves at odds with each other and the local culture.\n\n\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0499549/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0499549/&lt;/a&gt;\nUser Rating:Top 250: #103 (8.4/10)\nGenre:Action | Adventure | Fantasy | Sci-Fi \n\n \nVideo\nFormat : xvid\nCodec ID : xvid\nBit rate : 1 151 Kbps\nWidth : 720 pixels\nHeight : 480 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio : 3:2\nFrame rate : 29.970 fps\nStandard : NTSC\nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.111\nStream size : 646 MiB (96%)\n\nAudio\nID : 1\nFormat : MPEG Audio\nFormat version : Version 1\nFormat profile : Layer 3\nMode : Joint stereo\nFormat_Settings_ModeExtension : MS Stereo\nCodec ID : 55\nCodec ID/Hint : MP3\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 32.0 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\nStream size : 18.0 MiB (3%)\nAlignment : Aligned on interleaves\nInterleave, duration : 24 ms (0.72 video frame)\nInterleave, preload duration : 24 ms\nWriting library : LAME3.97\n\n\nScreenshots\n\nh*t*t*p*://*i45*.*tinypic*.*com/2u4ln2v.jpg","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d5b5a58a073a3b3d0c24c246c154016282160747","amp;dn":"Avatar.3D.2009.DVDRip-playOFF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d5b5a58a073a3b3d0c24c246c154016282160747","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,181,165,138,7,58,59,61,12,36,194,70,193,84,1,98,130,22,7,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
