For instance, Boston and Baltimore are now the stuff of waterfront redevelopment legend. Waterfronts in Post-Industrial Cities is a second generation waterfront publication which reflects on recent and contemporary developments. Amsterdam, Boston, Genoa, Sydney and Vancouver are successful examples of cities that faced considerable challenges in their revitalisation efforts. Bilbao, Havana, Las Palmas de Gran Canaria and Shanghai are contemporary examples that represent the emerging contexts for waterfront revitalisation today.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d7dfa77577dc11c8e053b1be38a3319b8ddbd34","amp;dn":"Waterfronts+in+Post-Industrial+Cities+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d7dfa77577dc11c8e053b1be38a3319b8ddbd34","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,125,250,119,87,125,193,28,142,5,59,27,227,138,51,25,184,221,189,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
