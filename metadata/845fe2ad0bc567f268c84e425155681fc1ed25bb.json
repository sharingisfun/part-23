It\\&amp;#039;s streuous and some chars are\\&amp;#039;nt even online anymore. That\\&amp;#039;s why MFG exists. For noobs and normal folk that don\\&amp;#039;t want to miss out on the MUGEN craze.\n\nQ - Is this version 2?\nA - the answer is only half yes... This is the \\&quot;condensed\\&quot; version of the new version. That are\\&amp;#039;nt as many chars but the quality of the game is much higher than the first.\n\nQ - Why make 2 versions?\nA -  The slim version is for people following the quality over quantity and the fatty is for the people in a vice-versa philosophy.\n\nQ - Is this Illegal?\nA - No, it\\&amp;#039;s alright\n\nQ - Are\\&amp;#039;nt prepackaged games againist the mugen community rules...\nA - Yes and No, theres alot of grey line there so I\\&amp;#039;m not bothering with it. They\\&amp;#039;re are people acting like the police that are\\&amp;#039;nt and way too much drama. I just want to release something to make it easier on people getting into mugen.\n\nQ - I think MFG is awesome and want to join the team\nA - There are awesome forums at www.dacforever.com and a wiki that needs finished. Just make yourself known.\n\nQ - I have just a few suggestions for it\nA - same thing\n\nQ - This SOUNDTRACK/CHAR/STAGE SUCKS remove it from the pack!!!\nA - post on the forums and we\\&amp;#039;ll see. if I don\\&amp;#039;t agree then you can remove it from your game using the tools I included\n\nQ - How do I change the background music\nA - By copying the mp3 to the sound folder, opening the stageviewer (in the configurating mugen folder), selecting the stage, going to (Options &gt; Change Music) and selecting that mp3\n\nQ - How do I add a char/stage to it\nA - Mugen Windows Configurator should be able to do it just add it to that specific folder and click add (char/stage) and doyuble click on the def file. Just remember to delete the randomselect if it\\&amp;#039;s a char\n\nQ - MFj isn\\&amp;#039;t working!!!!\nA - you can get it to your pcs specs by going to the config option in mugen windows configurator.
