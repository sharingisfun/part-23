Still, the gorgeous brunette at the bar in Fool's Gold looks harmlessÃ¢â‚¬â€until she takes him home and he discovers a room devoted to securing a man, for life. \n\nDellina Hopkins never guessed that storing gowns from a friend's bridal boutique would chase away her first and only fling. After her parents died, she skipped her &quot;wild youth&quot; to raise her sisters. She doesn't want forever from Sam, but one nightÃ¢â‚¬â€all nightÃ¢â‚¬â€would've been nice.
