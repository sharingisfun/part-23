Born in Palermo, Italy, Mortellaro grew up listening to old-school hip-hop and jungle, and at the age of 18, a fascination with percussion, drumming, and rhythm drew him to Siena, Italy to study. While there, Mortellaro learned to play the tabla and studied Indian classical music, something that would go on to become an important rhythmic foundation to his later production work. A move to Paris a few years later saw him begin his first venture into electronic music and a demo, picked up by British producer James Holden, cemented a friendship that would go on to inspire Mortellaro. In 2007 the first two Lucy releases appeared, the minimal techno-and electro-influenced Glass Computer and Open House EPs. Following a year later, two more releases -- The Liar EP and Downstairs -- appeared on Ercolino's Meerestief Records. A move from Paris to Berlin brought new influences to Mortellaro's sound and in 2009 he set up his own label, Stroboscopic Artefacts.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d658bc8259eb3b5939734f03acfa8f8887926063","amp;dn":"Lucy+-+Churches+Schools+and+Guns+%282014%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d658bc8259eb3b5939734f03acfa8f8887926063","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,88,188,130,89,235,59,89,57,115,79,3,172,250,143,136,135,146,96,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
