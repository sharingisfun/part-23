Much of the material was recycled in the film and accompanying album Himself. The story of the car with the airplane engine was previously attributed to Fat Albert, while on this album the owner is referred to as &quot;Charlie Waynes&quot;. The car in the Fat Albert sketch was a 1941 Mercury. The car on this album is a 1942 DeSoto. This album and his previous Capitol Records album were repackaged in Australia as a two-CD set in 1992 called The Bill Cosby Collection.\nURL \n\nUPLOADER'S NOTE - Bill Cosby's two 1977 Capitol Records comedy albums (My Father Confused Me &amp; Bill's Best Friend) have only ever been released on CD in Australia under the title: The Bill Cosby Comedy Collection. For purists, I have uploaded a FLAC copy of that 2-CD album to this site with proper EAC rip logs. This torrent is each disk FROM that collection released with its appropriate original artwork and Discogs information, as if those albums HAD been released separately as CDs. This makes it easier to assemble a collection of CosbyÃƒâ€ s work. They are precisely the same (I have the old LPs in my closet), but were not technically released under those titles. I am sure this matters to SOMEBODY, so I wanted to note that. Additionally - while the comedy here is quite good - whoever did the sound for these albums should be arrested. I've never heard such a butchering. Bits end and leap suddenly into applause at its zenith, which can be quite jarring to the listener.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b45f62256c7294ba70eb2b48975290765d93f7b2","amp;dn":"Bill+Cosby+-+Bill%27s+Best+Friend+%5B1977%5D+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b45f62256c7294ba70eb2b48975290765d93f7b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,95,98,37,108,114,148,186,112,235,43,72,151,82,144,118,93,147,247,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
