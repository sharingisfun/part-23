However if you have 10.3 or lower, there is a way that you can downgrade your sysnand to 9.2.0. (You will need to research it on a site like gbatemp.net to figure out how to do it).. But if you are on sysnand 10.4 or higher, it is not possible (at the time of this writing) to downgrade or hack your 3DS with out using a hardware-modified 3DS and a back-up of your NAND before it was updated in to an unhackable version range..\r\n\r\nI have confirmed it to work at least with this set up:\r\nnew-3DS\r\nsysnand: 9.2.0\r\nemunand: 10.4.0\r\ngateway launcher software version: 3.7.1","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b941fb5ff06fea9700d5f44d5518291ba58cccc4","amp;dn":"%5B3DS%5D+Minna+no+Pokemon+Scramble+%5BJPN%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b941fb5ff06fea9700d5f44d5518291ba58cccc4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,65,251,95,240,111,234,151,0,213,244,77,85,24,41,27,165,140,204,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
