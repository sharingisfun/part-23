Most suck at injecting because the AJ coders\ndon't seem to give two shits and just use a MONSTER delay on their loader.  Well \nmaybe they care but don't have a fucking clue ?  I will improve on their shit and\nlet you set a delay based on what you need.  Some games like AVA will need a 0 or 1 \nseconds delay.  Others like APB could need 60 seconds.  Play with it and find a delay \nthat works for you,\n\nGUI requires .NET 2.5 runtimes\nMy MemoryLoader.dll needs VS2005 runtimes\n\nThis release includes the following cheats\n\n\n[Undetected]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d098c18d31db40c2df3be2fc33eeafa194a12d2","amp;dn":"BF3+Aimbot+%5BUndetected%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d098c18d31db40c2df3be2fc33eeafa194a12d2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,9,140,24,211,29,180,12,45,243,190,47,195,62,234,250,25,74,18,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
