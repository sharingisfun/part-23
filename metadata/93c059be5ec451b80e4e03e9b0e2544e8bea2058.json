The original monaural LP of Miles in Europe\nconsisted of edited versions of &quot;Autumn Leaves,&quot; &quot;Joshua&quot; and &quot;All of You,&quot; now\nrestored to their full length, as well as &quot;Milestones,&quot; &quot;I Thought About You&quot; and\n&quot;Walkin'.&quot; Finishing the hundred-and-four minute set is &quot;Bye Bye Blackbird,&quot; which\nsegues into &quot;Bye Bye (Theme),&quot; both previously unreleased. With only a month\nunder its belt, the quintet already begin to take broad liberties with the material,\ndemonstrating the more orchestral approach that the group would hone further\nover the years to follow.\n\n\n\nPersonnel\n\n\nMiles Davis (trumpet), Ron Carter (bass), George Coleman (tenor saxophone on\ndiscs 1-5), Victor Feldman (piano on disc 1), Frank Butler (drums on disc 1), Herbie\nHancock (piano on discs 2-7), Tony Williams (drums on discs 2-7), Sam Rivers\n(tenor saxophone on disc 6), Wayne Shorter (tenor saxophone on disc 7)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.
