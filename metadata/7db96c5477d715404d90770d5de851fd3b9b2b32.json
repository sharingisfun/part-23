During his short career he had a major influence on the development of modern jazz in Sweden.\n\nFredriksson was born in Eskilstuna, Sweden. He played at the beginning of the 1960s in a quartet with Bobo Stenson (piano), Palle Danielsson (bass) and Fredrik NorÃƒÂ©n (drums), as well as in groups with Eje Thelin and Bernt Rosengren. He played with the guitarist Rune Gustaffson in 1961 and with Bosse Broberg's quartet in 1962 at the Golden Circle Jazz Club in Stockholm. He recorded Intervall, (Columbia 1966), together with the posthumous, self titled BÃƒÂ¶rje Fredriksson, (EMI/Odeon, 1969). In 1968 he committed suicide.\nFredriksson's sheet music was left in the hands of Bobo Stenson, and in 1994 he, Danielsson and NorÃƒÂ©n reconvened with saxophonist Joakim Milder, and released an album of Fredriksson's music entitled Sister Maj's Blouse. A follow-up, Epilogue, appeared in 1998 with the same ensemble.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7db96c5477d715404d90770d5de851fd3b9b2b32","amp;dn":"B%26ouml%3Brje+Fredriksson+Quartet+-+Intervall+%281966%29+MP3%40320kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7db96c5477d715404d90770d5de851fd3b9b2b32","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,185,108,84,119,215,21,64,77,144,119,13,93,232,81,253,59,155,43,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
