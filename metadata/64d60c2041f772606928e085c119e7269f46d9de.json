It is a collection of remixes and remakes from previous albums. Most of the songs from the Enter the Realm EP, Iced Earth, and Night of the Stormrider were re-sung by Matt Barlow, and on some of the songs the drums and bass were redone. The 2-cd version also has rough mixes of several songs from Burnt Offerings with the opening to the titular track re-recorded. The album cover features artwork of the Chaos Comics character Purgatori.\n\nThe reason for the album was to improve the original songs, create nostalgia for older fans and introduce newer fans to Iced Earth's older work. The 2-CD limited edition was originally produced for European audiences but has since been released in the United States. Days of Purgatory was the last new release from the band featuring longtime guitarist Randall Shawver, and the first to feature bassist James MacDonough and drummer Brent Smedley.\n\nThe song &quot;Written on the Walls&quot; from the band's self titled album was given completely new lyrics and renamed &quot;Cast in Stone&quot;. The only songs left unrecorded from the band's first albums were &quot;Mystical End&quot;, &quot;The Path I Choose&quot;, and &quot;Curse the Sky&quot;, though the latter two were both performed live with Barlow on vocals. &quot;Winter Nights&quot; was recorded during early sessions for Night of the Stormrider while Gene Adam was still on vocals, but this was the track which prompted Schaffer to ask Adam to get singing lessons, as it was felt he could not handle the high notes. Therefore, the song was not used on the album due to its acrimonious history, though it would have fit in with the storyline of the album. Live performances of this song from that era (such as Wuppertal '91) show him struggling to sing it, probably contributing to his dismissal. Schaffer eventually dug the song out of the vaults to use on this album with Barlow providing vocals, but, as mentioned in the album's booklet, used a 1986 Purgatory demo for the backing track instead.Track listing\nOne CD edition\nNo. \tTitle \tLyrics \tMusic \tOriginal album \tLength \t\n1. \t&quot;Enter the Realm&quot;   \t(instrumental) \tJon Schaffer \tEnter the Realm \t0:54\n2. \t&quot;Colors&quot;   \tSchaffer \tRandall Shawver, Schaffer \tIced Earth \t4:50\n3. \t&quot;Angels Holocaust&quot;   \tSchaffer \tSchaffer \tNight of the Stormrider \t4:53\n4. \t&quot;Stormrider&quot;   \tSchaffer \tShawver, Schaffer \tNight of the Stormrider \t4:47\n5. \t&quot;Winter Nights&quot;   \tSchaffer \tSchaffer \t(previously unreleased) \t3:55\n6. \t&quot;Nightmares&quot;   \tSchaffer \tSchaffer \tEnter the Realm \t3:42\n7. \t&quot;Pure Evil&quot;   \tSchaffer \tShawver, Schaffer \tNight of the Stormrider \t6:33\n8. \t&quot;Solitude&quot;   \t(instrumental) \tShawver, Schaffer \tIced Earth \t1:44\n9. \t&quot;When the Night Falls&quot;   \tSchaffer \tSchaffer \tIced Earth \t9:01\n10. \t&quot;Desert Rain&quot;   \tSchaffer \tSchaffer, Dave Abell \tNight of the Stormrider \t6:56\n11. \t&quot;The Funeral&quot;   \t(instrumental) \tShawver, Schaffer \tIced Earth \t6:15\n12. \t&quot;Cast in Stone&quot; (rewritten version of &quot;Written on the Walls&quot;) \tMatt Barlow \tShawver, Schaffer, Abell \tIced Earth \t5:59\n13. \t&quot;Reaching the End&quot;   \tSchaffer \tSchaffer \tNight of the Stormrider \t1:11\n14. \t&quot;Travel in Stygian&quot;   \tSchaffer \tSchaffer \tNight of the Stormrider \t9:32\n15. \t&quot;Iced Earth&quot;   \tSchaffer \tSchaffer \tIced Earth \t5:22\nPersonnel\n\n    Jon Schaffer - Rhythm Guitar, Vocals\n    Randall Shawver - Lead Guitar\n    Matthew Barlow - Lead Vocals\n    Brent Smedley - Drums on 1,2,5,6,9,21\n    James MacDonough - Bass Guitar on 1,2,5,6,9,21\n    Dave Abell - Bass Guitar on 3,4,7,8,10-20\n    Mike McGill - Drums on 10,11,13,16\n    Richey Secchiari - Drums on 3,4,7,8,14,18,19\n    Rodney Beasley - Drums on 12,15,17,20\n\nAdditional personnel\n\n    Howard Helm - Keyboards\n    Kent Smith - Keyboards\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:64d60c2041f772606928e085c119e7269f46d9de","amp;dn":"Iced+Earth-Days+Of+Purgatory++mp3++320k++a2k++1997+++++++++","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"64d60c2041f772606928e085c119e7269f46d9de","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,214,12,32,65,247,114,96,105,40,224,133,193,25,231,38,159,70,217,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
