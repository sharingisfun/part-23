They actually started long before the Beatles, but it wasn't until after the Liverpool quartet hit that they saw any success in England or America. Their biggest British success was a version of the Contours' &quot;Do You Love Me,&quot; but the hottest number on their first album was a searing (by British standards) rendition of &quot;I Want Candy,&quot; later popularized by the Strangeloves, whose Bo Diddley-based beat, Bob Porter and company handled with admirable style. Poole later faded into obscurity, while the Tremeloes achieved success on their own.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-tremeloes-p442664/biography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-tremeloes-p442664/biography&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Review (by Bruce Eder):\n\nBack in the early '90s, when this 20-song compilation came out, it was more music by the Tremeloes than had been seen in America in decades, and it was absolutely essential listening -- the Tremeloes' music is so upbeat and enjoyable, that they could significantly improve the collective frame of mind of our society if their work was better known. Rhino's best-of is a decent cross-section of the band's work from early 1967 through 1974, covering their best and best-known singles. The sound here is a mix of late-era (almost retro) British beat (&quot;Suddenly You Love Me,&quot; &quot;Too Many Fish in the Sea&quot;), white soul (&quot;Ain't Nothin' But a House Party&quot;), and Beatlesque pop/rock (&quot;Here Comes My Baby,&quot; &quot;Hello World&quot;), all of it so catchy that even the most lethargic listener might well be moved to get up and dance to much of it. The hits are augmented by three album cuts and a pair of tracks (&quot;You Can't Touch Sue,&quot; &quot;Do I Love you&quot;) that never previously appeared in America, all mastered to Rhino's usual high standard by Bill Inglot.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-best-of-the-tremeloes-rhino-r20435&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-best-of-the-tremeloes-rhino-r20435&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAmazon.com's page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000032G9&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000032G9&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
