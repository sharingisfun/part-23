She is then brought to Southern Cross, the lordÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s castle, where she is forced into tough child labour. Another child, Dominique, suffers the same torment and must bear with the fits of the lordÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s son, a violent and unpredictable child. Day after day, the woods around Southern Cross seem to animate and have a life of their own. Has Iliane inherited the powers of her mother? And where does this eerie wind blowing in the region come from...?  This fantastic tale of the middle ages is set apart by its troubling story and the splendid art of Raquel Alzate, great hope of comic artists.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a14e6b186fa5e88438fc16cbcc9f66adc0950cc","amp;dn":"Southern+Cross","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a14e6b186fa5e88438fc16cbcc9f66adc0950cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,20,230,177,134,250,94,136,67,143,193,108,188,201,246,106,220,9,80,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
