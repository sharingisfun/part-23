With stunning visuals and deep gameplay, this game takes everything you liked about Far CryÃ‚Â® and ramps it up to 11.\nYou are a gun for hire, trapped in a war-torn African state, stricken with malaria and forced to make deals with corrupt warlords on both sides of the conflict in order to do what it takes to take down the Jackal, a dirty arms merchant who has made your new homeland a war-torn hell.\nYou must identify and exploit your enemiesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ weaknesses, neutralizing their superior numbers and firepower with surprise, subversion, cunning, and of course, brute force.\nThis is the Fortune's Edition of Far CryÃ‚Â® 2, which is patched up (like every GOG.com game) to the most recent version which includes the Fortunes Pack DLC that added three new weapons and two new vehicles to the game, as well as several new multiplayer maps.\nMultiplayer notice: In order to access the multiplayer portion of the game, you must first register a Uplay account and enter your unique CD-key. Your CD-key is located on your game shelf.\nOne of the most interactive and destructible environments ever made for an open world game, with special attention paid to a realistic fire engine that's a pyromaniac's dream come true.\nFight for different rival factions as you confront the ugly truths about conflict in a poor, war-torn country.\nGreat story complemented by fantastic open world first-person gameplay!\n\nMinimum system requirements - Windows: Supported OS: WindowsÃ‚Â® XP / VistaÃ‚Â® / WindowsÃ‚Â® 7 Processor: Dual-core processor 2.6 GHz IntelÃ‚Â® PentiumÃ‚Â® D or AMD AthlonÃ¢â€žÂ¢ 64 3500+ RAM: 1 GB Windows XP / 2 GB Windows Vista Video Card: 256 MB DirectXÃ‚Â® 10.0Ã¢â‚¬â€œcompliant video card or DirectX 9.0Ã¢â‚¬â€œcompliant card with Shader Model 3.0 or higher Sound Card: DirectX 9.0 or 10.0Ã¢â‚¬â€œcompliant sound card (5.1 sound card recommended) Hard Drive Space: 12 GB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c7153dc3f632c4cd7e5b681e3c8437a5c7c55727","amp;dn":"Far+Cry+2%3A+Fortune%27s+Edition+%28GOG%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c7153dc3f632c4cd7e5b681e3c8437a5c7c55727","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,21,61,195,246,50,196,205,126,91,104,30,60,132,55,165,199,197,87,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
