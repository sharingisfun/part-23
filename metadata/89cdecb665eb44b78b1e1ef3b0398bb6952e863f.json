L. Ershov, E. A. Palyutin. \n\n  This book presents in a systematic way a number of topics in modern\n  mathematical logic and the theory of algorithms. It can be used as\n  both a text book on mathematical logic for university students and\n  a text for specialist courses. The sections corresponding to the\n  obligatory syllabus (Sections 1 to 9 of Chapter 1,without the small\n  type, Sections 10 and 11 of Chapter 2, Sections 15 and 16 of Chapter\n  3,Sections 18 to 20, 22 and 23 of Chapter 4 and Section 35of Chapter\n  7) are written more thoroughly and in more detail than the sections\n     relating to more special questions.\n     The exposition of the propositional calculus and the calculus of\n     predicates is not a conventional one, beginning as it does with a\n     study of sequential variants of the calculi of natural deduction\n     ( although the traditional calculi, referred to as Hilbertian,\n     also appears here). The reasons for this are: \n     A) the possibility of providing a good explanation of the meaning\n     of all the rules of inference;\n     B) the possibility of acquiring more rapidly the knack of making\n     formal proofs;\n     C) a practical opportunity of making all the formal proofs\n     necessary in the course for these calculi.\n\n  This book was translated from the Russian by Vladimir Shokurov. The\n  book was published by first Mir Publishers in 1984.\n  \n  All credits to the original uploader.\n\n  DJVU | OCR | 4.3 MB | Pages: 302 |  \n\n======================================\n=++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++=\n=+                                  +=\n=+ Released on TPB by mirtitles.org +=\n=+                                  +=\n=++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++=\n======================================\t\n\nTable of Contents\n\nPreface 7 \nINTRODUCTION 9 \n\nChapter 1.\nTHE PROPOSITIONAL CALCULUS 15 \n\nChapter 2.\nSET THEORY 65\n\nChapter 3. \nTRUTH ON ALGEBRAIC SYSTEMS 96\n\nChapter 4.\nTHE CALCULUS OF PREDICATES 117\n\nChapter 5.\nMODEL THEORY 149\n\nChapter6.\nPROOF THEORY 198\n\nChapter7.\nALGORITHMS AND RECURSIVE FUNCTIONS236\n\nList of symbols 292\nSubject Index  295\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:89cdecb665eb44b78b1e1ef3b0398bb6952e863f","amp;dn":"Ershov%2C+Palyutin+Mathematical+Logic","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"89cdecb665eb44b78b1e1ef3b0398bb6952e863f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,205,236,182,101,235,68,183,139,30,30,243,176,57,139,182,149,46,134,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
