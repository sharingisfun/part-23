Their original lineup consisted of vocalist Ian McCulloch, guitarist Will Sergeant and bass player Les Pattinson, supplemented by a drum machine.The band's cult status was followed by mainstream success in the mid-1980s, as they scored a UK Top 10 hit with &quot;The Cutter&quot;, and the attendant album, Porcupine (1983), reached number 2 in the UK. Their next release, Ocean Rain (1984), continued the band's UK chart success, and has since been regarded as their landmark release, spawning the hit singles &quot;The Killing Moon&quot;, &quot;Silver&quot; and &quot;Seven Seas&quot;. One more studio album, Echo &amp; the Bunnymen (1987), was released before McCulloch left the band to pursue a solo career in 1988.\n\nLyrics:\nStab a sorry heart\nWith your favorite finger\nPaint the whole world blue\nAnd stop your tears from stinging\nHear the cavemen singing\nGood news they're bringing\n\nSeven seas\nSwimming them so well\nGlad to see\nMy face among them\nKissing the tortoise shell\n\nA longing for\nSome fresher feeling\nBelonging\nOr just forever kneeling\nWhere's the sense in stealing\nWithout the grace to be it\n\nSeven seas\nSwimming them so well\nGlad to see\nMy face among them\nKissing the tortoise shell\n\nBurning my bridges and smashing my mirrors\nTurning to see if you're cowardly\nBurning the witches with mother religious\nYou'll strike the matches and shower me\nIn water games, washing the rocks below\nTaught and tamed in time with tear flow\n\nSeven seas\nSwimming them so well\nGlad to see\nMy face among them\nKissing the tortoise\n\nSeven seas\nSwimming them so well\nGlad to see\nMy face among them\nKissing the tortoise\n\nSeven seas\nSwimming them so well\nGlad to see\nMy face among them\nKissing the tortoise shell ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b06bf2eaf30427eab8bc576dd2b956543409d94a","amp;dn":"Echo+And+The+Bunnymen+-+Seven+Seas","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b06bf2eaf30427eab8bc576dd2b956543409d94a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,107,242,234,243,4,39,234,184,188,87,109,210,185,86,84,52,9,217,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
