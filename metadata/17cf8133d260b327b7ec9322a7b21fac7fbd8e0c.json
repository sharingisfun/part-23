This is an &quot;upgrade&quot; / &quot;license file&quot; for the normal Chainfire3D program, you must already have the free version installed or nothing will happen !!\n\nTake control over your GPU!\n\nChainfire3D is an intermediary OpenGL driver. What does that mean? It means that Chainfire3D sits between your apps and the graphics drivers, and can intercept and/or change commands between the two. It has some built-in functions, and can be further extended with plugins to provide extra functionality.\n\n!! Android 2.1 and newer. Now available for Honeycomb - but still a big risk there !!\n\n!! Chainfire3D is for 1ghz+ devices only !!\n\n!! ROOT is required for this program, as well as a writable /system partition. S-OFF is also required on HTC devices !!\n\nFeatures include reducing texture size and quality to reduce memory use and potentially increase game performance, as well as increasing memory use potentially increase performance.\n\nIf you also install the (experimental) EGL driver, AND your GPU supports it, AND you have the Pro version, you can enable 4xMSAA or 16xMSAA on a per-app bases. This can drastically improve image quality!\n\nBe sure to check the thread on XDA for available plugins !\n( http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1087427 )\n\nChainfire3D has been tested on:\n- HTC HD2\n- Samsung Galaxy S\n- Samsung Galaxy Tab 7&quot;\n- Samsung Galaxy S II\n- Samsung Galaxy Note\n- Samsung Epic 4G\n- Motorola Atrix 4G\n- Motorola Droid 2\n- LG Optimus 2X\n- Google Nexus S\n\nMany users are running Chainfire3D on devices not listed here - it's likely to work on all modern devices. So far nobody has reported a failed install, so that's good. Doesn't mean problems can't happen.\n\n!! There is some risk involved installing the driver. Your device may not boot. If you have CWM, it would be prudent to create a backup before installing !!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:17cf8133d260b327b7ec9322a7b21fac7fbd8e0c","amp;dn":"Chainfire+3D+Pro+v3.3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"17cf8133d260b327b7ec9322a7b21fac7fbd8e0c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,207,129,51,210,96,179,39,183,236,147,34,167,178,31,172,127,189,142,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
