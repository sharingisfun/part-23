In keeping with the familial theme, the Compton native addresses topics including adoption (the heartfelt Brenda Russell duet &quot;I Am Your Mother Too&quot;), love for a step-parent (&quot;Color Him Father&quot;), and thankfulness for a blessed life (a Bonnie Raitt-like &quot;Infinite Eyes&quot;). Goosing along this occasionally weighty collection are a few instances of Keb' Mo' loosening up, particularly on a jumping version of Slim Gaillard's jive classic &quot;The Flat Foot Floogie&quot; and a playful duet with son Kevin Jr. on Joni Mitchell's &quot;Big Yellow Taxi.&quot;\n\nRecorded at Groove Masters Studio and Sony Studios, Santa Monica, California; A Cut Above Studio, Ventura, California; House Of Blues Studio, Encino, California.\n\n1.
