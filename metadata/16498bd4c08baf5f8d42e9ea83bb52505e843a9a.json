The emphasis from the beginning is on core concepts and practical application of AutoCAD in Architecture, Engineering and Design. \n\nEqually useful in instructor-led classroom training or self-study, the book is written with the student in mind by a long time AutoCAD user and instructor, based on what works in the industry and the classroom.\n\nStrips away complexities, both real and perceived and reduces AutoCAD to easy-to-understand basic concepts.\n\nExplains why something is done, not just how the theory behind each concept or command is discussed prior to engaging AutoCAD, so the student has a clear idea of what they are attempting to do.\n\nAll basic commands are documented step-by-step: what the student types in and how AutoCAD responds is spelled out in discrete and clear steps with numerous screen shots.\n\nExtensive supporting graphics (screen shots) and a summary with a self-test section and topic specific drawing exercises are included at the end of each chapter. Additional practice is gained through projects that the students work on as they progress through the chapters.\n\nAlso available in a comprehensive volume that includes coverage of 3D drawing and modeling in AutoCad. \n\nYou can use the free acrobat reader to view this or;\n\nAdobe Acrobat X Pro;         &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5961888&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5961888&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAdobe Acrobat 9 Pro;         &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5628228&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5628228&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAdobe Acrobat 9 Pro Extended;         &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5130222&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5130222&lt;/a&gt;\n\nMicrosoft Visual Studio 2010 training DVD;       &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6046077&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6046077&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:16498bd4c08baf5f8d42e9ea83bb52505e843a9a","amp;dn":"UP+%26+RUNNING+WITH+AUTOCAD+2011+%5Bthethingy%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"16498bd4c08baf5f8d42e9ea83bb52505e843a9a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,73,139,212,192,139,175,95,141,66,233,234,131,187,82,80,94,132,58,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
