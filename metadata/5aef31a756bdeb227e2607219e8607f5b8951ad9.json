Have mercy if it's not working :)\n\n ---\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“RevelationsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ takes place between Episodes 3 and 4 of the Star Wars Saga. Emperor Palpatine's power has spread throughout the galaxy. Darth Vader is a feared figure. The Jedi are hunted fugitives. Anyone suspected of harboring Jedi or having any information about them is taken into Imperial custody.\n\nOur heroine, Taryn Anwar, has broken way from Imperial control and is searching for an ancient Jedi artifact. Said to contain great power, it could be the key to destroying the Empire -- if she can locate it before Zhanna, the EmperorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Hand, does. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a race between good and evil as the fate of the galaxy hangs in the balance.\n\nRevelations tells it's story around it's own unique characters and worlds around the Star Wars universe in which the only original star wars characters you will see from the films are, the Emperor, Vader, stormtroopers, and various aliens that makes Star Wars. &amp;quot;Revelations&amp;quot; is very unique in it own way of look and feel, yet still within the Star Wars galaxy. We wanted to make something that was our own and not a simple retelling of Star Wars, or ideas and looks that have been explored before. We tried to make a film with the things and ideas we always wanted to see.\nIn the end, the script went through roughly 12 revisions by the time you watch it, and some were on the fly as we tightened and tweaked the story we wanted to tell or strengthen characters and deliveries. We think the end result is a fast pace film that takes you for quite a ride. We give a lot of looks for &amp;quot;Revelations&amp;quot; that is very exciting. It's a film we wanted to make in which we do not dummy down the exposition or story, and you really have to pay attention or you will miss things. A lot happens in 40 mins!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5aef31a756bdeb227e2607219e8607f5b8951ad9","amp;dn":"Star+Wars+Revelations","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5aef31a756bdeb227e2607219e8607f5b8951ad9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,239,49,167,86,189,235,34,126,38,7,33,158,134,7,245,184,149,26,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
