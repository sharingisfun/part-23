Cleric John Preston (Bale) is a top ranking government agent responsible for destroying those who resist the rules. Whe he misses a dose of Prozium, a mind-altering drug that hinders emotion, Preston, who has been trained to enforce the strict laws of the new regime, suddenly becomes the only person capable of overthrowing it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf02b0e9f2eae13687203294433959f9b3dd33a8","amp;dn":"Equilibrium","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf02b0e9f2eae13687203294433959f9b3dd33a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,2,176,233,242,234,225,54,135,32,50,148,67,57,89,249,179,221,51,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
