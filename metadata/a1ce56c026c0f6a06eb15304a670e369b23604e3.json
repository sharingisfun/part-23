Higginbotham, clarinetist Albert Nicholas and altoist Charlie Holmes along with what was arguably (thanks to bassist Pops Foster and drummer Paul Barbarin) the top rhythm section of the period. This CD from Collector's Classics, (which is made available through Storyville) only has one session from the prime period (two songs plus a previously unissued version of &quot;The Way He Loves Is Just Too Bad&quot;) but has all of Russell's earlier and slightly later recordings. Best are the initial two sessions, six titles plus an alternate take that feature hot jazz in 1926 from such fine players as George Mitchell or Bob Shoffner on cornet, Kid Ory or Preston Jackson on trombone, Nicholas or Darnell Howard on clarinet, pianist Russell and Johnny St. Cyr on banjo. However the most impressive soloist is clarinetist Barney Bigard, who sticks exclusively to tenor and stakes out his claim as the number two tenor player (behind Coleman Hawkins) of the period. In addition three rare sessions from 1930-31 hint at the band's former greatness (trumpeter Red Allen stars but there are also some indifferent vocals) and this CD closes with the six titles from Russell's 1934 date (highlighted by Rex Stewart's dynamic cornet on &quot;Ol' Man River&quot;). Collectors will want this one. ~ Scott Yanow, All Music Guide\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a1ce56c026c0f6a06eb15304a670e369b23604e3","amp;dn":"The+Luis+Russell+Collection+%281926-1934%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a1ce56c026c0f6a06eb15304a670e369b23604e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,206,86,192,38,192,246,160,110,177,83,4,166,112,227,105,178,54,4,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
