R. R. Tolkien.\n\n\nSet in a time &quot;Between the Dawn of FÃƒÂ¦rie and the Dominion of Men&quot;, The Hobbit follows the quest of home-loving hobbit Bilbo Baggins to win a share of the treasure guarded by the dragon, Smaug. Bilbo's journey takes him from light-hearted, rural surroundings into more sinister territory. By accepting the disreputable, romantic, fey and adventurous side of his nature and applying his wits and common sense, Bilbo gains a new level of maturity, competence and wisdom.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5eeb2b20848f2060eec0c36f6a014d1773704cca","amp;dn":"The+Hobbit","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5eeb2b20848f2060eec0c36f6a014d1773704cca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,235,43,32,132,143,32,96,238,192,195,111,106,1,77,23,115,112,76,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
