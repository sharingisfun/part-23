As PEG could be utilized as a green replacement for organic        \n   solvents, phase-transfer catalyst, surfactant, support in various         \n   reaction systems, significantly promoting catalytic activity and          \n   recovering expensive metal catalysts, particularly regarded as a          \n   CO2-philic material, the authors focus on special applications of PEG     \n   in CO2 capture and utilization, including PEG-functionalized catalysts    \n   for efficient transformation of CO2 and PEG-functionalized absorbents     \n   for efficient CO2 capture. Furthermore, they describe carbon capture      \n   and utilization strategy as an alternative approach to address the        \n   energy penalty problem in carbon capture and storage. Interestingly,      \n   the authors also discuss PEG radical chemistry in dense CO2 as rather     \n   creative and unusual use of PEG, presumably serves as a reaction medium   \n   and a radical initiator for radical chemistry.                            \n\n  +-[ ALEXANDRIA ]----------------------------------------------------------+\n  : The Royal Library of Alexandria, or Ancient Library of Alexandria, in   :\n  : Alexandria, Egypt, was the largest and most significant great library   :\n  : of the ancient world. It flourished under the patronage of the          :\n  : Ptolemaic dynasty and functioned as a major center of scholarship from  :\n  : its construction in the 3rd century BC until the Roman conquest of      :\n  : Egypt in 30 BC. The library was conceived and opened either during the  :\n  : reign of Ptolemy I Soter (323-283 BC) or during the reign of his son    :\n  : Ptolemy II (283-246 BC).                                               /:\n  +-----------------------------------------------------------------:_/--/:+  \n    &quot;With knowledge, comes wisdom - and wisdom should be shared.&quot;       /","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b08327a01310941808491dcf934c948b57e066f4","amp;dn":"Springer+-+Capture+and+Utilization+of+Carbon+Dioxide+With+Polyet","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b08327a01310941808491dcf934c948b57e066f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,131,39,160,19,16,148,24,8,73,29,207,147,76,148,139,87,224,102,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
