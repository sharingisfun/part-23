With the integrated Diagram and Outline Views, they create graphic organizers and expand topics into writing. This powerful combination encourages learning in multiple modes. As a result, students gain and retain a better understanding of concepts and demonstrate knowledge, improving their performance across the curriculum.\n\nImprove 6th to 12th grade skills:\n\n    * Plan and organize\n    * Research and evaluate\n    * Comprehend and communicate\n\n\t\n\n\nEducators use Inspiration to customize instruction, achieve standards, assess student projects and energize learning. An expanded selection of 120+ cross-curricular templates in language arts, social studies, science, planning and thinking makes starting assignments quick and easy.\n\nVisualize ideas, concepts and relationships\nIn Diagram View, students create graphic organizers ? a core element of visual learning ? to analyze, compare and evaluate information. They quickly brainstorm new ideas with the RapidFire tool, search the symbol collection to find images to represent any concept, and insert and play multimedia files. To show relationships between ideas, students link symbols and add words to further clarify meaning.\n\nImprove writing proficiency\nAs they start the writing process, students use visually integrated notes to expand topics and switch to Outline View to further develop their ideas. The integrated Word Guide helps students choose words with more precision, and a contextual spell checker automatically identifies misspelled words. To finalize projects, students can transfer to their favorite word processor or transform their work into a web site with the Site Skeleton export tool.\n\nPlan and organize projects\nInspiration helps students organize information, develop thinking skills and demonstrate knowledge. Drag-and-drop actions and hyperlinks make it easy to gather research and connect to files and web resources. As students develop their projects, they use AutoArrange to automatically format their diagrams.\n\nInspiration Web Resources\n\n    * More than 1 million symbols\n    * 50+ Curriculum Packets\n    * On-demand training videos","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b32731162399bffb1e60cdc2aefbe0a42edfb58","amp;dn":"Inspiration.v8.0a.WinALL.Cracked-ViRiLiTY.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b32731162399bffb1e60cdc2aefbe0a42edfb58","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,50,115,17,98,57,155,255,177,230,12,220,42,239,190,10,66,237,251,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
