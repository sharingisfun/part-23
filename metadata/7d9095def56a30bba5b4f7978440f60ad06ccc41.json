The Satanic Screen documents all of Satan's cinematic incarnations, covering not only the horror genre but also a whole range of sub-genres including hardcore porn, mondo and underground film.\n\nHeavily illustrated with rare still photographs, posters and arcana, the book also investigates the perennial symbiotic interplay between Satanic cinema and leading occultists (for example, Aleister Crowley), making it essential reading for anyone interested in the Black Arts and their continuing representation in populist culture.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nNikolas Schreck is an American living in Germany. He is an accomplished writer, musician and film-maker, and has appeared on TV and radio shows around the world as a leading authority on occultism, true crime and other mysterious phenomena. He is the editor of The Manson File (Amok, 1988) and director of the 1989 film Charles Manson Superstar","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d9095def56a30bba5b4f7978440f60ad06ccc41","amp;dn":"The+Satanic+Screen+%282001%29+%28Pdf%29+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d9095def56a30bba5b4f7978440f60ad06ccc41","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,144,149,222,245,106,48,187,165,180,247,151,132,64,246,10,208,108,204,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
