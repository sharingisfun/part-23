Some songs are based on the poems of the Norwegian poet Astrid Krogh Halse. These include &quot;FÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¸lgje&quot; (&quot;Companion&quot;) and &quot;Stengd DÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¸r&quot; (&quot;Closed Door&quot;). The music consists of guitars, violins, synthesizers/keyboards, drums, and the distinctive voice of Gunnhild Sundli.\n\nIselilja is their second album, and was released in 2004.\n\nAll files are in .mp3 format, mostly 192-320kbp/s.
