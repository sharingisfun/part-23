Whenever longtime\r\nDowntown musician, plays here (and any where else I imagine), he takes his time\r\nto set up all of his half dozen instruments and then play them one at a time\r\ndepending on who is playing with. Mr. Carter remains the most democratic of\r\nmusicians, refusing to be a group leader so that all members of whatever group\r\nhave their say and lead or direct in their own way. Although, Mr. Carter is\r\nassociated with the Downtown Free Scene, he is never predictable with whom he\r\nchooses to play with and what direction any session will take. Starting out\r\nquietly and building, there is a somber, spacious vibe when this disc\r\nbegins. It is good to hear Mr. Carter playing piano, something he rarely gets\r\nto do and sounds fine playing freely and controlled exuberance. When he\r\nswitches to tenor, he erupts fiercely. Mr. Ughi is a marvelous drummer and a\r\nperfect foil for Carter. The balance and energy exchange is always as one\r\nforce. There is a lovely section for flute and drums played with the hands\r\nwhich is most enchanting. This followed by another sublime duo for muted\r\ntrumpet and brushes. Federico is especially fine on mallets, often elegant and\r\nuplifting. This entire disc is one long spirited dialogue between two old\r\nfriends, righteous, good-natured and always ringing true.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nOn cdbaby \nhttp://www.cdbaby.com/cd/danielcarterandfedericou\r\n\r\nBy Stef \nhttp://www.freejazzblog.org/2015/04/daniel-carter-federico-ughi-extra-room.html\r\n\r\nBy Alberto Bazzurro (it) \nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/extra-room-daniel-carter-577-records-review-by-alberto-bazzurro.php","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:236235e3158f34d08647c3bd0a775e3b06604f34","amp;dn":"Daniel+Carter+and+Federico+Ughi+-+Extra+Room+%282015%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"236235e3158f34d08647c3bd0a775e3b06604f34","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,98,53,227,21,143,52,208,134,71,195,189,10,119,94,59,6,96,79,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
