This music is seriously epic - you've probably heard a handful of these tracks in some big game and movie trailers. The most recent trailer I've seen with Cliff Lin's music is the new Black Ops 2 &quot;reveal&quot; with the song Ultraviolence (on his This is War disc).\n\nYou can classify these tracks under heavy metal, industrial rock, electronica, action rock, soundtrack... it has a little bit of orchestral element and a bit of background vocals. It's all epic though - brilliant stuff and heavy action oriented.\n\nIf you aren't sure you'll like it, look up Cliff Lin in grooveshark and stream a few tracks, or check out the sample bits on amazon.com.
