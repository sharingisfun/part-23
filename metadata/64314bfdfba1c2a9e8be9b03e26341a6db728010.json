At its core, PrayFit is about effort: giving your best in two areas that are vital to well-beingÃ¢â‚¬â€faith and fitness. The underlying approach is simple: Make a daily appointment to spend quality time with the Lord and to exercise.\nThis 28-day plan guides readers of any fitness level to begin a workout routine that can be done at home with little to no equipment, to make small but effective changes in their diet and to grow in biblical knowledge and spiritual strength. As they follow the specially designed meal plans and workouts, readers will see the physical results of their efforts almost immediatelyÃ¢â‚¬â€and as they reflect on the daily devotional reading (contributions from Pastor Jimmy Page, VP of Field Ministry and National Director of Wellness for the Fellowship of Christian Athletes) and Scripture verses, they will begin to understand the eternal dimension of giving their best. Living GodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s promised abundant life isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t only about faith . . . though thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s where it starts. PrayFit is the best way to claim that promise both inside and out.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:64314bfdfba1c2a9e8be9b03e26341a6db728010","amp;dn":"Prayfit%3A+Your+Guide+to+A+Healthy+Body","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"64314bfdfba1c2a9e8be9b03e26341a6db728010","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,49,75,253,251,161,194,169,232,190,155,3,226,99,65,166,219,114,128,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
