Stone was in her late-30s when this album was released, having made her recording debut as part of the Sugar Hill rap trio The Sequence 20 years earlier. An in-demand session singer, she performed on works by Lenny Kravitz and Mantronix.  The album is named after her teenage daughter Diamond TiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ara.\n\n\n            &quot;The Storm Is Over Now&quot; is a single by American R&amp;B singer R. Kelly from his fourth solo studio album.  It's the second single on that album and a 4:35 minute music video has been made for the song. The song was not released in the US, it charted at number 18 on the UK chart and below 15 on two other countries. The song is both written and produced by R. Kelly himself.\n\n              &quot;The Life &quot; is a  song written and performed by  Mystic released as a single in June 19, 2001 and included in the album &quot;Cuts for Luck and Scars for Freedom &quot; of the same year. Featuring a combination of R&amp;B, hip hop and Soul, &quot;Cuts for Luck&quot; was met with positive reviews and helped Mystic receive a BET award nomination for Best Female Hip-Hop Artist. The album did not perform well commercially, however, and to date she has yet to release a follow-up album.\n\n               &quot;Your Woman&quot;  is Sunshine Anderson's debut album. The album featured her Hot R&amp;B/Hip Hop number one single, &quot;Heard It All Before&quot;, and the follow-up single, &quot;Lunch or Dinner&quot;. The album was certified Gold in 2001.\n\n14.12.  CONTEMPORARY R&amp;B  (2000 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ present)\n\n          By the 2000s, the cross-pollination between R&amp;B and hip hop had increased to the point where, in most cases, the only prominent difference between a record being a hip hop record or an R&amp;B record is whether its vocals are rapped or sung.\n       Mainstream modern R&amp;B has a sound more based on rhythm than hip hop soul had, and lacks the hardcore and soulful urban Ã¢â‚¬Å“grindingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ feel on which hip-hop soul relied. That rhythmic element descends from new jack swing. R&amp;B began to focus more on solo artists rather than groups as the 2000s progressed. As of 2005, the most prominent R&amp;B artists include Usher, Beyonce  and Mariah Carey whose music often blurs the line between contemporary R&amp;B and pop.\n\n           \nLUCY PEARL  - DONÃ¢â‚¬â„¢T MESS WITH MY MAN   (2000)\nWYCLEF JEAN &amp; MARY J.BLINGE -  911  (2000)\nTONI BRAXTON  -  HE WASNÃ¢â‚¬â„¢T MAN ENOUGH   (2000)\nDANTE THOMAS   -  Miss California (2001)\nMARY J BLIGE  -  Family Affair  (2001)\nR.

Even today, all around the world, classic soul is as popular now as it was during its early days back in the 1960s. But although there are plenty of soul legends, there are also plenty of contemporary artists keeping the legacy of the art form alive. Anthony Hamilton, Mary J. Blige and others are among the deep, gritty soul artists who are among today's best.\n\nROBERTA FLACK  - KILLING ME SOFTLY WITH THIS SONG  (2000) \nSOLOMON BURKE - DON'T GIVE UP ON ME   (2003)\nLIONEL RICHIE  -  SAY YOU , SAY ME   (2007)\nTHE 5th DIMENSION   - AQUARIUS &amp; LET THE SUN SHINE IN (2007}\n\n\n\n           Neo soul is a term coined by music industry entrepreneur Kedar Massenburg during the late 1990s.  According to music journalist Greg Kot, musical collective Soulquarians with members from Philadelphia, New York, Detroit, Richmond, Brooklyn, Chicago, Dallas, and Oakland., contributed significantly to the neo soul movement during the late 1990s to the early 2000s. The founding members of the collective are Ahmir Thompson a.k.a. Questlove from The Roots, D'Angelo, James Poyser, and J Dilla. Being a collective, they included a rotating list of members, including Common, Mos Def, Talib Kweli, Q-Tip, Erykah Badu, Bilal  and Raphael Saadiq.\n         During the early to mid 1990s, the neo soul movement continued to grow with releases by Zhane, Groove Theory, Joi, Tony Rich, and Me'Shell NdegeOcello.  Other  neo soul artists broke through with their debut albums, including Macy Gray, Angie Stone, Lauryn Hill and Jill Scott.  The 1997 film Love Jones capitalized on neo soul's success at the time with its soundtrack album, which impacted the Billboard charts and featured artists such as Hill, Maxwell, The Brand New Heavies, Me'Shell NdegeOcello, Groove Theory, and Dionne Farris. \n\n\nANGIE STONE  -  Life Story   (1999)\nANGIE STONE   -  Wish I Didn't Miss You (2001)\nGNARLS BARKLEY  -  Crazy  (2006)   \nGNARLS BARKLEY  Vs..RAZE - Crazy.4.Love  (Pomatic.Mashup.Mix.)\nGNARLS BARKLEY  -  Who's Gonna Save My Soul   (2008)\nREBECCA FERGUSON  -  Backtrack  (2012)\nREBECCA FERGUSON  -  Glitter &amp; Gold  (2012)\n\n        \n\n        Hip hop soul is sub-genre of contemporary R&amp;B which fuses R&amp;B, neo soul and dance elements with hip hop. The term did not originate until the promotion for Mary J. Blige's debut album Ã¢â‚¬Å“What's the 411?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½  in 1992 when Uptown Records proclaimed her to be the &quot;Queen of Hip Hop Soul&quot; and generally describes a style of music that blends soulful R&amp;B singing and raw hip hop production. The genre served as a middle point between two other hip hop/R&amp;B blends, new jack swing and neo soul, and while it was most popular during the mid-1990s with the &quot;Queen of Hip Hop Soul&quot; Mary J. Blige, Jodeci, and Aaliyah, it still finds popularity with newcomers such as Ashanti, Beyonce, Aaliyah, Alicia Keys, Keyshia Cole and Amerie.\n\nMYSTIC  -  The Life  (2001)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e5d2c9d65628fcabfcf8fa4360fe81dd58b63e0","amp;dn":"HISTORY+OF+POP+AND+ROCK+MUSIC+-+part+572","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e5d2c9d65628fcabfcf8fa4360fe81dd58b63e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,93,44,157,101,98,143,202,191,207,143,164,54,15,232,29,213,139,99,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
