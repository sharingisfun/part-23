Authored by two leading experts, this comprehensive reference thoroughly addresses every component of governance. The authors carefully synthesize current academic and professional research, summarizing what is known, what is unknown, and where the evidence remains inconclusive. Along the way, they illuminate many key topics overlooked in previous books on the subject. Coverage includes:\n\n    * International corporate governance.\n    * Compensation, equity ownership, incentives, and the labor market for CEOs.\n    * Optimal board structure, tradeoffs, and consequences.\n    * Governance, organizational strategy, business models, and risk management.\n    * Succession planning.\n    * Financial reporting and external audit.\n    * The market for corporate control.\n    * Roles of institutional and activist shareholders.\n    * Governance ratings.\n\nThe authors offer models and frameworks demonstrating how the components of governance fit together, with concrete examples illustrating key points. Throughout, their balanced approach is focused strictly on two goals: to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œget the story straight,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and to provide useful tools for making better, more informed decisions.\n\n\n\n# Hardcover: 496 pages\n# Publisher: Pearson Prentice Hall; 1 edition (April 24, 2011)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 013218026X\n# ISBN-13: 978-0132180269","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:106fb279895d9fb69a093f50d5bb7d3e29d4ed7b","amp;dn":"Corporate+Governance+Matters%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"106fb279895d9fb69a093f50d5bb7d3e29d4ed7b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,111,178,121,137,93,159,182,154,9,63,80,213,187,125,62,41,212,237,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
