I cannot offer any support on it. It worked for me, and that was all the proof I needed.\n\nNote: \nThis patch ONLY works for version 1.0.1204.1301!\n\nInstallation:\n\n1. If Xsplit is not installed already, install it using &quot;xsplit_installer_v1.0.1204.1301.exe&quot;.\n2. Run Xsplit Patcher.exe\n3. Click &quot;Patch&quot;\n4. Select &quot;XSplit.Core.exe&quot;, which is located in the Xsplit install path. ( &quot;C:Program Files (x86)SplitMediaLabsXSplit&quot; or  &quot;C:Program FilesSplitMediaLabsXSplit&quot; )\n5. You're done. That was easy, wasn't it? :)\n\nDo NOT update Xsplit, it will undo the patch.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a71bef6b09cb931d2951f5b9b6f54dd27aac99e9","amp;dn":"Xsplit+1.0.1204.1301+%2B+Patch+%2F+Crack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a71bef6b09cb931d2951f5b9b6f54dd27aac99e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,27,239,107,9,203,147,29,41,81,245,185,182,245,77,210,122,172,153,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
