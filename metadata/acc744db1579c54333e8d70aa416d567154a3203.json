For nearly forty years scientists thought they knew the content of our planet and all of its contents. In the late 1930s the world of chemical science began to discover elements beyond Uranium - the 'transuranics'. These new, super-heavy elements are probably not found in nature at all but can be detected, if only for a few fractions of a second, in precisely designed experiments using powerful nuclear tools. On Beyond Uranium: Journey to the End of the Periodic Table is full of exciting new concepts and tells the story of the author's quest to discover elements never before known to man.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:acc744db1579c54333e8d70aa416d567154a3203","amp;dn":"On+Beyond+Uranium%3A+Journey+to+the+End+of+the+Periodic+Table","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"acc744db1579c54333e8d70aa416d567154a3203","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,199,68,219,21,121,197,67,51,232,215,10,164,22,213,103,21,74,50,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
