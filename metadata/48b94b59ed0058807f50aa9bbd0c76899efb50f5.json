The book then goes on to discuss the electrolysis process and the characteristics, advantages, drawbacks, and challenges of the main existing electrolysis technologies. Current manufacturers and the main features of commercially available electrolyzers are extensively reviewed. The final chapters then present the possible configurations for integrating water electrolysis units with renewable energy sources in both autonomous and grid-connected systems, and comment on some relevant demonstration projects.\r\nWritten by an internationally renowned team from academia and industry, the result is an invaluable review of the field and a discussion of known limitations and future perspectives","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:48b94b59ed0058807f50aa9bbd0c76899efb50f5","amp;dn":"Hydrogen+Production+by+Electrolysis","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"48b94b59ed0058807f50aa9bbd0c76899efb50f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,185,75,89,237,0,88,128,127,80,170,155,189,12,118,137,158,251,80,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
