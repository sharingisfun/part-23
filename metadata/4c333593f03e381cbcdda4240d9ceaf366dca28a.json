Both dramatically fall in love, but must part company temporarily in order to let him seek his mother's blessings and get married. When Shyam returns home, his mother, Sita, is relieved to see him alive as she had been told by Diwan that he had been missing. Shortly thereafter, he will be introduced to Kala, the daughter of his mother's late friend, Kamla, who, his mother's hopes, will be her future daughter-in-law. On the occasion of his birthday, Kala and established dancer/singer, Shalini Kapoor, have a competition, a conniving Diwan arranges an accident which results in Kala's abduction, while Shyam passes out. When he does regain his senses he is unable to remember anything/anybody.
