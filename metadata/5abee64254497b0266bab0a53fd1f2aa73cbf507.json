(1977)\nS02E03 The Thigh Bone&amp;#039;s Connected to the Knee Bone\nFirst aired: 2/11/1977\n\nA thigh bone is found buried on the building site of a new student union building. Quincy is teaching a class at the university and soon involves himself and his students with to whom the bone belongs, how they died and possibly even who killed him. Not surprisingly Monaghan and Asten consider this a complete waste of time and want Quincy to get back to his job and stop bothering them.
