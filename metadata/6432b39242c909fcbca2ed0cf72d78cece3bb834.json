Following a tragic set of circumstances leading to his wife's murder at the hands of a malevolent Demi-God named Tera, our hero lands headfirst into the battle between good and evil - and his chances for survival are grim. However, Dellec is not one to back down from a fight no matter the foe - specifically when his own life hangs in the balance. Dellec is one man's quest for vengeance and redemption as he attempts to take on the very being that created mankind itself - God!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6432b39242c909fcbca2ed0cf72d78cece3bb834","amp;dn":"Dellec+Vol.+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6432b39242c909fcbca2ed0cf72d78cece3bb834","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,50,179,146,66,201,9,252,188,162,237,12,247,45,120,206,206,59,184,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
