Tebar's bebop-borne chops keep pace with virtuoso DeFrancesco's thrust on the Hammond B-3, but it's far from a screaming, gritty organ set. A more smooth vibe steams off this recording. Highlights are the great swinging Ginger Bread Boy, the Wes Montgomery-influenced playing on Sugar and the uptempo classic The Champ. Excellent timekeeping all the way from Muhammad.\n\n\nTracklisting:\n01. Ginger Bread Boy (Heath) - 5:50\n02. But Not for Me (Gershwin-Gershwin) - 5:04\n03. Nica's Dream (Silver) - 8:57\n04.
