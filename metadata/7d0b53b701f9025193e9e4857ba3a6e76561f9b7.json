Fairly late in life, Rublyov became a monk, first at Trinity-St. Sergius at Sergiyev Posad and then at the Andronikov monastery in Moscow. Russian painters did not sign their works until the 17th century, so paintings can be assigned to him only on the basis of written evidence or of style. Written evidence associates with his name wall paintings at Vladimir and Moscow and the panel, or icon, of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Old Testament Trinity.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ By analogy of style a number of other icons can also be attributed to him, the chief of these being panels of St. John the Baptist, St. Paul, St. Peter and the Ascension, done in 1408 for the Cathedral of the Dormition of the Virgin at Vladimir, and others of the Archangel Michael and the Saviour from Zvenigorod, now in the Tretyakov Gallery.\n\nRublyov was trained wholly in the Byzantine tradition, in which the spiritual essence of art was regarded as more important than naturalistic representation. The hieratical character of the mid-Byzantine style had, with the 14th century, given way to a more intimate, humanistic approach, but to this Rublyov was able to add an element that was truly Russian, a complete unworldliness, and it is this that distinguishes his work from that of his Byzantine predecessors. Nor was any later Russian painter ever quite able to equal Rublyov either in his handling or in the interpretation of his subject.\n\n\nEnglish, Romanian and Russian subtitles.\n\n\nFor more subtitles and extras here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4484872/Andrej_Rubljov___Tarkovskij__2_disc_DVD-9&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4484872/Andrej_Rubljov___Tarkovskij__2_disc_DVD-9&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d0b53b701f9025193e9e4857ba3a6e76561f9b7","amp;dn":"Andrey+Rublyov+%281966%29+%28Andrei+Rublev%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d0b53b701f9025193e9e4857ba3a6e76561f9b7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,11,83,183,1,249,2,81,147,233,228,133,123,163,166,231,101,97,249,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
