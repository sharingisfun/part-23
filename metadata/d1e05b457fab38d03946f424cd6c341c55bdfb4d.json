Whether theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re collecting antique weapons, practicing concealed carry, or firing an AR-15 or a Glock at their local range, many Americans love gunsÃ¢â‚¬â€which horrifies and fascinates many other Americans, and much of the rest of the world. This lively, sometimes raucous book explores from the inside the American love affair with firearms.\n\nDan Baum is both a lifelong gun guy and a Jewish Democrat who grew up in suburban New Jersey feeling like a Ã¢â‚¬Å“child of a bitter divorce with allegiance to both parents.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ In Gun Guys he grabs his licensed concealed handgun and hits the road to meet some of the 40 percent of Americans who own guns. We meet Rick Ector, a black Detroit autoworker who buys a Smith &amp; Wesson after suffering an armed robberyÃ¢â‚¬â€then quits his job to preach the gospel of armed self-defense, especially to the resistant black community; Jeremy and Marcey Parker, a young, successful Kentucky couple whose idea of a romantic getaway is the Blue Ridge Mountain 3-Gun Championship in Bowling Green; and Aaron Zelman, head of Jews for the Preservation of Firearms Ownership. Baum also travels to New Orleans, where he enters the world of a man disabled by a bullet, and to Chicago to interview a killer. Along the way, he takes us to gun shows, gun stores, and shooting ranges trying to figure out why so many of us love these things and why they inspire such passions.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d1e05b457fab38d03946f424cd6c341c55bdfb4d","amp;dn":"Gun+Guys%3A+A+Road+Trip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d1e05b457fab38d03946f424cd6c341c55bdfb4d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,224,91,69,127,171,56,208,57,70,244,36,205,108,52,28,85,189,251,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
