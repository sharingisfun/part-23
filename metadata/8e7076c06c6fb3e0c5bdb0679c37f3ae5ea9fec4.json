The single is the title track from Silhouette, the new album out October 6th. Recorded in LondonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s renowned RAK Studios, the album is an inspired mix of freshly-minted new songs and sparkling, reggaefied cover versions of classics by The Beatles, Bob Dylan, The Chi-Lites and others. The track Silhouette was originally a 1957 hit for the American doo-wop group The Rays, though this new, yearning take, owes more to an early 1970s version by the crown prince of reggae, the late Dennis Brown.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e7076c06c6fb3e0c5bdb0679c37f3ae5ea9fec4","amp;dn":"Ali+Campbell+-+Silhouette+%2818th+Aug+2014%29+320kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e7076c06c6fb3e0c5bdb0679c37f3ae5ea9fec4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,112,118,192,108,111,179,224,197,189,176,103,156,55,243,174,94,169,254,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
