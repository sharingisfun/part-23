His life became self-centered with fame and fortune.\n\nIn 1964, his wife June, left him, taking their daughter with her. Less than a year later, DaveÃ¢â‚¬Ëœs father, a minister in York, Pennsylvania, passed away.\n\nAt that point, his self-inflicted hurt became too much. He left the 500 Club that night and drove towards a little town in Pennsylvania where he hoped to kill himself on the railroad tracks.\n\nOn the way, however, he passed a little church that brought back happy memories of his childhood, his father and family. Hurting and crying, he fell to his knees, and then forced himself to a pay phone where he called his brother who was now pastor of  his fatherÃ¢â‚¬Ëœs church.\n\nHis brother drove out to meet him and in the wee hours of the morning after a lot of praying, Joey Stevens was laid to rest forever and Dave Boyer was reborn in Christ. \n\nTrack Listing:\n1. A Broken Heart I Gave\n2. Savior Like a Shepherd Lead Us\n3. If I Could Tell You\n4. Precious Lord Take My Hand\n5. The Lord's Prayer\n6. Faithfully\n7. Yes He Did\n8. Just A Moment Ago\n9.
