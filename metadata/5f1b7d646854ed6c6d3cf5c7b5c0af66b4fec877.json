Digital darkroom techniques show how to fix, enhance and rescue images that would otherwise have been consigned to the computer trash. To help the reader avoid those mistakes in the future, in depth tutorials and articles cover all the aspects of great photography. Lighting is probably the biggest factor in getting a great image and Digital Photography Enthusiast aims to demystify the subject putting the facts at the fingertips of the reader. This along with the rules of composition, when to break them and subjects from models to how to wildlife shots, will ensure that whatever the reader is into, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve got it covered. In this digital age thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s never been more hardware and software available for both the hobbyist and the pro and DPE navigates the minefield for both.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f1b7d646854ed6c6d3cf5c7b5c0af66b4fec877","amp;dn":"Digital+Photography+Enthusiast+-+July+2012+%28.PDF%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f1b7d646854ed6c6d3cf5c7b5c0af66b4fec877","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,27,125,100,104,84,237,108,109,60,245,199,181,192,175,102,180,254,200,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
