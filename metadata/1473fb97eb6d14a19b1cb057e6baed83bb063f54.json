I used anime-max quality setting. Depending on length of the episode, average bitrate is about 3000 +/- 100. I also kept the original screen size of 720x576, and the original 192k AC3 sound. I watched every episode after it was encoded and they are amazing.\n\nI realize it&amp;#039;s 37 gigs, but I never turn my computer off, and it will have given out a copy before a week. I promise it&amp;#039;s worth it if you&amp;#039;re patient.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1473fb97eb6d14a19b1cb057e6baed83bb063f54","amp;dn":"Futurama.x264+mkvs.All+episodesus+movie","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1473fb97eb6d14a19b1cb057e6baed83bb063f54","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,115,251,151,235,109,20,161,155,28,176,87,230,186,237,131,187,6,63,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
