The courtroom scene is entirely too long, but I suppose that is a problem with most courtroom scenes. The rest is pretty good, in a B-movie way. I've enjoyed it 3 or 4 times... but then, I have no life :-) I especially like the pulpy pre-title sequence.\n\n*****************\n\nPlease seed at least 1:1, a bit more if you can.
