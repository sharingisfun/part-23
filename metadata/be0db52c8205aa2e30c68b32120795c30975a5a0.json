A forthright, earnest, and earthy vein courses through the works of Jesse Waugh, as he endeavors to deliver pulchritude manifest.\n\nThe compendium concludes with The Pulchrist Manifesto, which should serve to define the art movement which has been inaugurated by Jesse Waugh.\n\n\nABOUT THE ARTIST\nJesse WaughÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s art has been exhibited in various galleries and at the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art.
