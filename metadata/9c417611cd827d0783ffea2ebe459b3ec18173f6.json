But we shouldÃ¢â‚¬â€even those of us who take care of our business in pristine, sanitary conditions. For itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not only in developing countries that human waste is a major public health threat: population growth is taxing even the most advanced sewage systems, and the disease spread by waste kills more people worldwide every year than any other single cause of death. Even in America, 1.95 million people have no access to an indoor toilet. Yet the subject remains unmentionable.\n\nThe Big Necessity takes aim at the taboo, revealing everything that matters about how people doÃ¢â‚¬â€and donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢tÃ¢â‚¬â€deal with their own waste. Moving from the deep underground sewers of Paris, London, and New YorkÃ¢â‚¬â€an infrastructure disaster waiting to happenÃ¢â‚¬â€to an Indian slum where ten toilets are shared by 60,000 people, Rose George stops along the way to explore the potential saviors: ChinaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s five million biogas digesters, which produce energy from waste; the heroes of third world sanitation movements; the inventor of the humble Car Loo; and the U.S. ArmyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s personal lasers used by soldiers to zap their feces in the field.\n\nWith razor-sharp wit and crusading urgency, mixing levity with gravity, Rose George has turned the subject we like to avoid into a cause with the most serious of consequences.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9c417611cd827d0783ffea2ebe459b3ec18173f6","amp;dn":"George%2C+Rose+-+The+Big+Necessity_The+Unmentionable+World+of+Huma","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9c417611cd827d0783ffea2ebe459b3ec18173f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,65,118,17,205,130,125,7,131,255,234,46,190,69,155,62,193,129,115,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
