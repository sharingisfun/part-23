That anything less than sexual multiplicity . . . is naive? That our sexual selves are merely idylers in a vast wood?&quot; Thus the central theme of John Hawkes's widely acclaimed novel The Blood Oranges is boldly asserted by its narrator, Cyril, the archetypal multisexualist. Likening himself to a white bull on Love's tapestry, he pursues his romantic vision in a primitive Mediterranean landscape. There two couplesÃ¢â‚¬â€Cyril and Fiona, Hugh and CatherineÃ¢â‚¬â€mingle their loves in an &quot;lllyria&quot; that brings to mind the equally timeless countryside of Shakespeare's Twelfth Night.\n\nYet no synopsis or comparison can convey the novel's lyric comedy or, indeed, its sinister powerÃ¢â‚¬â€sinister because of the strength of will Cyril exerts over his wife, his mistress, his wife's reluctant lover; lyric, since he is also a Ã¢â‚¬Å“sex-singer&quot; in the land where music is the food of love.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:34826956c9f23044c5a0e3674027ecaa14d1152f","amp;dn":"Hawkes%2C+John+-+The+Blood+Oranges.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"34826956c9f23044c5a0e3674027ecaa14d1152f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,130,105,86,201,242,48,68,197,160,227,103,64,39,236,170,20,209,21,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
