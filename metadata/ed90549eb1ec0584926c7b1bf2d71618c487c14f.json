And each will captain their negation and ridicule before eventually, on the third day, falling into some kind of teary and blissful acceptance.\n\nThis is a story of happiness, regardless of the hurt and suffering of which it is sometimes garbed.\n\nwww.cseanmcgee.com\n\nTheFreeArtCollection\n\nComing Soon:\n\nThe Time Traveler's Wife\n\nRock Book Volume III: Still Life\n\nThrough The Multiverse\n\nTake Risk and Take Care,\n\nC.SeanMcGee","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed90549eb1ec0584926c7b1bf2d71618c487c14f","amp;dn":"Happy+People+Live+Here+%28Kobo%29+by+C.SeanMcGee","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed90549eb1ec0584926c7b1bf2d71618c487c14f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,144,84,158,177,236,5,132,146,108,123,27,242,215,22,24,196,135,193,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
