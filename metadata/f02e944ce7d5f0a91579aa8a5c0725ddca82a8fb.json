That is a lot of money for the powerful private prison industry, which spends millions of dollars on lobbying and now operates nearly half of the country's immigration detention centers.\n\nFault Lines travels to Texas and Florida to investigate the business of immigrant detention in the US and to find out how a handful of companies have managed to shape US immigration laws.\n\nFlv: http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/faultlines/2012/04/201241081117980874.html\n\n\n\nALSO:\nPBS - Prisons for Profit (XviD)\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/search/pbs%20now%20prisons%20for%20profit/0/99/0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/search/pbs%20now%20prisons%20for%20profit/0/99/0&lt;/a&gt;\n\nCorporations are running many Americans prisons, but will they put profits before prisoners?\n\nA grim new statistic: One in every hundred Americans is now locked behind bars. As the prison population grows faster than the government can build prisons, private companies see an opportunity for profit. \n\nCompanies like Corrections Corporation of America say they're doing their part to solve the problem of inmate overflow and a shortage of beds without sacrificing safety.\n\n\nshunster","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f02e944ce7d5f0a91579aa8a5c0725ddca82a8fb","amp;dn":"Fault+Lines-Punishment+and+Profits%3A+Immigration+Detention++2012+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f02e944ce7d5f0a91579aa8a5c0725ddca82a8fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,46,148,76,231,213,240,169,21,121,170,138,92,7,37,221,202,130,168,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
