Even if you don't know much about music, you can create music intuitively as if you were arranging sounds in space. The music that you see on the 16 Ãƒâ€” 16 grid of buttons is the music that is performed.\n\nOn the 16 Ãƒâ€” 16 grid of buttons, basically, the horizontal direction is time, and the vertical direction is pitch.By laying sounds on these buttons, you can combine rhythms and melodies to produce music. A button will glow when its sound is produced. The movements of the glowing lights produce a visual performance.\n\nTNR-i can produce 16 types of sounds at the same time (16 layers), and it can remember up to 16 song patterns produced using those sounds (16 blocks). By switching between song patterns in real time, you can produce a rich variety of musical expressions.\n\nThere are six different types of performance modes that you can select for each layer. You can make elaborate music by combining different modes. In score mode, the most fundamental of the modes, you can arrange sounds horizontally (temporally) and vertically (by pitch). In the exciting random mode, the sounds that you arrange are not just played in orderÃ¢â‚¬â€the melody and rhythm constantly change as twists are added. In draw mode, you can perform music by tracing your finger across the buttons as if drawing a picture. In bounce mode, the glowing lights are like bouncing balls that produce sound when they fall. In push mode, you can continuously change the sound as you perform. In solo mode, which is fun for solo performances, you can easily adjust the speed of repetition and the pitch.\n\nFirst, please try the demo. You can experience the joy of performance just by switching layers. \n- Loading the Demo: From the menu (touch the display), touch File menu, touch All Blocks, iD-Xtra_uncTK, and then Load. \n- Switching layers: Press R5 and the area that the 16 Ãƒâ€” 16 buttons are in at the same time. (You can double-tap R5 to hold it and make it easier to switch layers.)\n\nThe appeal of TNR-i isn't just limited to its faithful duplication of the TENORI-ON concept and its design and interface, which were developed under the supervision of Toshio Iwai.\nIf you are connected to a network, you can participate in TNR-i sessions with distant friends and others. Up to four people can connect to each other over a network and enjoy performing together at the same time.  \nPlease enjoy the world of TENORI-ON.\n\nNotes\n*You must have an Internet connection to participate in a network session. You also have to sign in to the Game Center.\n*User Voice is not available.\n*To run TNR-i smoothly, we recommend that you use an iPhone 4 or later or an iPod touch, 4th generation or later.\n*For the detailed information please refer to the following url. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.yamahasynth.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.yamahasynth.com&lt;/a&gt;\nWhat's new in Version 1.2.1\nFixed an issue no sound when mute switch is on.\nFaster response of buttons.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cca9ee2402a8b909f599a1e668ffd5296639e550","amp;dn":"TNR-i+Music+Maker+ipod.ipad.iphone","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cca9ee2402a8b909f599a1e668ffd5296639e550","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,169,238,36,2,168,185,9,245,153,161,230,104,255,213,41,102,57,229,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
