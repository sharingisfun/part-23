Posey's mid-'60s songs, almost all depicting a woman helpless without -- or alternately, trapped with -- &quot;her man,&quot; were slightly out of touch at the time and are artifacts now, but the slick pop-country arrangements have a timeless charm. Posey would have later success in the country charts in the '70s, but those hits are unfortunately not represented here. Though the album appears to be a straight reissue of MGM's The Best of Sandy Posey, this package actually expands on it by three tracks.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-best-of-sandy-posey-r200121&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-best-of-sandy-posey-r200121&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAmazon.com's page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000008Z8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000008Z8&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
