Some will give you a blank page for negotiations, while others \n\nwill ask for too much and others will be more sensible.\n There will be around a dozen new contact clauses, including a bonus for players making it into the Team of the Year and a minimum fee release clause if a big \n\nclub comes in.\n Negotiations with a player have been made &quot;face to face&quot; in order to increase the realism of the game.\n Training has been enhanced; there will be fourteen extra areas to train players in, and a new match preparation section allows you to train players in specific \n\nformations.\n Interaction with players and other managers has been improved, including making it possible to have private conversations with players.\n There are new board requests as part of this improved interaction, including requesting higher percentage of transfer revenue and requesting a new stadium if \n\nthe current stadium can't be expanded.\n The news section and inbox have been merged back together with a new look, and there are more options for subscriptions.\n The match engine has been improved to include player emotion, meaning players will react more visibly to what is happening on the pitch.\n The much-requested &quot;dynamic league reputation&quot; has been included, meaning that if game-players take on a club in a less fancied nation, and take that club to \n\nglory, the reputation of that nation's league will raise.\n\nOS\n    * Windows XP/Vista/W7\nProcessor\n    * XP : 1.4GHz or Faster\n    * Vista/W7 : 2.0GHz or Faster\n*Supported Processors: Intel Pentium 4, Intel Core, AMD Athlon\nMemory\n    * XP : 512MB RAM\n    * Vista/W7 : 1.0GB RAM\nHard Drive Space\n    * 2GB\nDVD-Drive\n    * 4x Speed\nVideo Card\n    * 128MB**\n      **Supported Chipsets : (see below)\nSound Card\n    * DirectX 9.0c compatible\nDirectx\n    * Version 9.0c (included)\nLAN\n    * TCP/IP compliant\nInput\n    * Keyboard, Mouse\n\n**Supported Chipsets - Nvidia FX 5900 Ultra or greater; ATI Radeon 9800 or greater; Intel 82915G/82910GL or greater.\nEarlier cards may only display 2D Match Viewer Mode and are not supported. \nEarlier cards may require the DirectX 9.0 SDK is installed to run the game.
