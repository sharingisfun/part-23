During the four-year period (1961 through 1966) represented by this collection, numerous jazz greats passed through the ranks of Wilson's big band, including Harold Land, Teddy Edwards, Richard &quot;Groove&quot; Holmes, Joe Pass, and Roy Ayers. The compilation includes exploratory arrangements of the Miles Davis composition &quot;Milestones&quot; and Thelonious Monk's &quot;'Round Midnight&quot; along with noteworthy Wilson-penned originals &quot;Jeri,&quot; &quot;Carlos,&quot; and &quot;Viva Tirado,&quot; which became a hit for the Latin rock band El Chicano in 1970. This a quality sampler for the novice, but will hold no interest for the hardcore collector. (AllMusic)\n\nTrack list:\n01. Blues For YNA YNA (1961)\n02. Jeri (1961)\n03. Moody Blue (1961)\n04.
