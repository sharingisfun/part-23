Kendo was later influenced in the 1930s and 1940s by ultra nationalist militarists and ultimately by the postwar government, which sought a gentler form of nationalism to rekindle appreciation of traditional culture among Japan's youth and to garner international prestige as an instrument of &quot;soft power.&quot; \r\n\r\nToday kendo is becoming increasingly popular internationally. But even as new organizations and clubs form around the world, cultural exclusiveness continues to play a role in kendo's ongoing evolution, as the sport remains closely linked to Japan's sense of collective identity","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f14b533f82e3ab8fa02ce183663de36d7a59e1ed","amp;dn":"Kendo+-+Culture+of+the+Sword+%282015%29.pdf+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f14b533f82e3ab8fa02ce183663de36d7a59e1ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,75,83,63,130,227,171,143,160,44,225,131,102,61,227,109,122,89,225,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
