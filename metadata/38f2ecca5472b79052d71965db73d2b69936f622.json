One of the most respected figures in the broadcasting industry, Roger Mosey has taken senior roles at the BBC for more than twenty years, including as editor of Radio 4Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Today programme, head of television news and director of the London 2012 Olympic coverage. Now, in Getting Out Alive, Mosey reveals the hidden underbelly of the BBC, lifting the lid on the angry tirades from politicians and spin doctors, the swirling accusations of bias from left and right alike, and the perils of provoking Margaret Thatcher. Along the way, this remarkable memoir charts the pleasures and pitfalls of life at the top of an organisation that is variously held up as a treasured British institution and cast down as a lumbering, out-of-control behemoth. Engaging, candid and very funny, Getting Out Alive is a true insider account of how the BBC works, why it succeeds and where it falls down","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:38f2ecca5472b79052d71965db73d2b69936f622","amp;dn":"Getting+Out+Alive+-+News%2C+Sport+and+Politics+at+the+BBC+%282015%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"38f2ecca5472b79052d71965db73d2b69936f622","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,242,236,202,84,114,183,144,82,215,25,101,219,115,210,182,153,54,246,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
