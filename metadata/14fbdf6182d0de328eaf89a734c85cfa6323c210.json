WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re Laura&amp;Claire, two female musicians and lifelong friends with a love for creating Ã¢â‚¬Ëœhaunting harmoniesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ (Not our words!) with a mix of alternative, pop and folk. This musical story of ours began when we were 9 years old and since then we have taken stories of love and loss and transformed them into acoustic songs for your listening pleasure. \n\nBased in the Northwest weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re constantly gigging in the Liverpool and Manchester area but make sure to look out for upcoming gigs as we hope to take our music to as many new places as possible! WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re currently trying to put together an EP, with possible title Ã¢â‚¬ËœChasing Social ButterfliesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, each track will be released as itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s recorded and available to download for free here!\n\nHere are 4 tracks we have so far, hope you like!\n \nLove L&amp;C x","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:14fbdf6182d0de328eaf89a734c85cfa6323c210","amp;dn":"Laura+%26amp%3B+Claire+EP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"14fbdf6182d0de328eaf89a734c85cfa6323c210","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,251,223,97,130,208,222,50,142,175,137,167,52,200,92,250,99,35,194,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
