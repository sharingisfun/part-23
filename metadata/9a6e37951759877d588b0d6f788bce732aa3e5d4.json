Fought at Redesdale, in Northumberland, in August 1388, the battle originated from the ongoing war between the Scots and the English but rapidly descended into a personal feud between the Scottish clan, Douglas, and the aristocratic English family, Percy. This book details the events that led up to this clash on the borders, using all the contemporary sources, gives a full account of the battle and examines the opposing armies and their weaponry, as well as the personalities of Black Douglas and Henry 'Hotspur' Percy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a6e37951759877d588b0d6f788bce732aa3e5d4","amp;dn":"Otterburn+1388%3A+Bloody+Border+Conflict","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a6e37951759877d588b0d6f788bce732aa3e5d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,110,55,149,23,89,135,125,88,139,13,111,120,139,206,115,42,163,229,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
