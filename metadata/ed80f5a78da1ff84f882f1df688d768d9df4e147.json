She shows how he had to adapt to a growing 'middling rank' in society no longer content with being downtrodden subjects. Affairs of state were being openly discussed in coffee houses, while the king and his ministers were mocked in satirical prints and theatres.\n\nGeorge II was an easy target - grumpy, and frequently absent in Hanover. To his British subjects he became The King Who Wasn't There. But his wife, the enlightened Caroline, popularized a medical breakthrough against smallpox. However, it was their son, Frederick Prince of Wales, who really understood this new world - he had the popular touch monarchy would need to survive into the modern era","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed80f5a78da1ff84f882f1df688d768d9df4e147","amp;dn":"The+First+Georgians+The+German+Kings+Who+Made+Britain+s01e02","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed80f5a78da1ff84f882f1df688d768d9df4e147","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,128,245,167,141,161,255,132,248,130,241,223,104,141,118,141,157,244,225,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
