Designed for both self-study and classroom use, this book builds a solid foundation in the general principles of natural water chemistry and then proceeds to a thorough treatment of more advanced topics. Key principles are illustrated with a wide range of quantitative models, examples, and problem-solving methods.\r\n\r\nMajor subjects covered include:\r\n* Chemical Thermodynamics\r\n* Solid-Solution Interface and Kinetics\r\n* Trace Metals\r\n* Acids and Bases\r\n* Kinetics of Redox Processes\r\n* Dissolved Carbon Dioxide\r\n* Photochemical Processes\r\n* Atmosphere-Water Interactions\r\n* Kinetics at the Solid-Water\r\n* Metal Ions in Aqueous Solution Interface\r\n* Precipitation and Dissolution\r\n* Particle-Particle Interaction\r\n* Oxidation and Reduction\r\n* Regulation of the Chemical\r\n* Equilibria and Microbial Mediation Composition of Natural Waters","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:83d3370b1dbf41fea80daa54d1b2ff943273ca08","amp;dn":"Aquatic+Chemistry+-+Chemical+Equilibria+and+Rates+in+Natural+Wat","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"83d3370b1dbf41fea80daa54d1b2ff943273ca08","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,211,55,11,29,191,65,254,168,13,170,84,209,178,255,148,50,115,202,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
