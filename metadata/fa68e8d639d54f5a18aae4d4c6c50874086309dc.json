Such is the music of William Basie.  At the other\n\nextreme are Lionel Hampton and Stephane Grapelli......great technical masters\n\nof their instruments.  My ears get numb listening to their impossible, nearly\n\nendless note flurries.  How pretentious of me to judge them.\n\n\nThis unusual trio setting for the Count is the sequel to this trio's first effort.\n\nUnlike many movie sequels, musical &quot;sequels&quot; aren't as often BAD.  Basie is \n\nlargely a bluesman IMO.  He was also a large bluesman.  Did Ray Brown ever make\n\na bad record?\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa68e8d639d54f5a18aae4d4c6c50874086309dc","amp;dn":"Count+Basie%3AKansas+City+3%2CForTheSecondTime%2C%281975%29Ray+Brown%2CPABLO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa68e8d639d54f5a18aae4d4c6c50874086309dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,104,232,214,57,213,79,90,24,170,228,212,198,197,8,116,8,99,9,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
