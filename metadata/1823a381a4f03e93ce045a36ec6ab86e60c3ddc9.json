Saxena asks him to travel to London for some business, which he does. Three months later when he returns home, he finds that Neela has not come to receive him at the airport, then on the way home, he is attacked, abducted, and placed in a cell, where a woman, Gulabiya, tells him that she is his sweetheart. With her help he manages to escape, has an accident, ends up in hospital, where he gets to meet a woman who calls him her son.
