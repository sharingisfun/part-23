I had heard many of the phrases in Korea, but until reading this book I didn't know what they meant, proof that this book is just as useful for advanced students as well as for pure beginners. My main gripe is with romanization. For example, Korean has an &quot;uh&quot; sound and an &quot;oh&quot; sound; in this book they are all written the same way. Also, the author has no knowledge of Korean grammar (e.g. he says &quot;mashida&quot; literally means &quot;liquid&quot;), which gives me less confidence to use phrases I have never heard before.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9404ba4ec30385b752648b686d0048becee36f61","amp;dn":"Making+Out+In+Korean","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9404ba4ec30385b752648b686d0048becee36f61","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,4,186,78,195,3,133,183,82,100,139,104,109,0,72,190,206,227,111,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
