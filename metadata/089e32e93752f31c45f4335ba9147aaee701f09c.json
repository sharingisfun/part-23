But is it design, functionality, fashion or friends that makes people covet the upgrade, and how far does the choice of gadgets define identity? Simon journeys across Britain and to South Korea in search of answers.\nThere was plenty of thought-provoking material here. I especially liked Armitage's assertion that younger generations are increasingly being denied a source of nostalgia, because nothing technological stays long enough in the home to stir affectionate memories. He has a point. My wife watched the programme alongside me and got quite misty-eyed about removing fluff from her stylus, while I remembered even the smell of our family Dansette record-player, in its cream-and-red leather-effect case.\nI suppose our children's generation might struggle on through life without ever knowing the satisfaction of removing fluff from a stylus, but it's hard to imagine them being wafted back in time by memories of their MP3 players and iPods, because the clever people at Sony and Apple will have come up with something new before the memories are fully formed. And even if they do recall their iPods in 2050, it surely won't be as wistfully as Armitage described his boyhood radio in the shape of an electric shaver, &quot;which only played Radio 1, in fact only seemed to play &quot;Grandad&quot; by Clive Dunn.&quot; Those were the days, my friend. Or was that Mary Hopkin?\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img169.imageshack.us/img169/1430/upgrademescreen0.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img169.imageshack.us/img169/1430/upgrademescreen0.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img84.imageshack.us/img84/9325/upgrademescreen1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img84.imageshack.us/img84/9325/upgrademescreen1.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img260.imageshack.us/img260/2084/upgrademescreen2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img260.imageshack.us/img260/2084/upgrademescreen2.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img176.imageshack.us/img176/87/upgrademescreen3.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img176.imageshack.us/img176/87/upgrademescreen3.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img84.imageshack.us/img84/6967/upgrademescreen4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img84.imageshack.us/img84/6967/upgrademescreen4.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img185.imageshack.us/img185/8895/upgrademescreen5q.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img185.imageshack.us/img185/8895/upgrademescreen5q.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img246.imageshack.us/img246/9421/upgrademescreen6.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img246.imageshack.us/img246/9421/upgrademescreen6.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img246.imageshack.us/img246/9421/upgrademescreen6.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img246.imageshack.us/img246/9421/upgrademescreen6.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img98.imageshack.us/img98/6604/upgrademescreen8.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img98.imageshack.us/img98/6604/upgrademescreen8.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;1e567779765e522d302f&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script data-cfhash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;data-cfhash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}t.parentNode.removeChild(t);}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nVideo Bitrate: 1791 Kbps\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.778 (16:9)\nVideo Resolution: 960 x 540\nAudio Codec: AAC LC\nAudio Bitrate: 128 Kbps CBR 48KHz\nAudio Channels: 2\nRun-Time: 45mins\nFramerate: 25fps\nNumber of Parts: 1\nPart Size: 755 MB\nContainer: mp4\nEncoded by: Harry65\nSource: PDTV\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:089e32e93752f31c45f4335ba9147aaee701f09c","amp;dn":"BBC+Upgrade+Me+PDTV+540p+x264+AAC+MVGroup.org","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"089e32e93752f31c45f4335ba9147aaee701f09c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,158,50,233,55,82,243,28,69,244,51,91,169,20,122,174,231,1,240,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
