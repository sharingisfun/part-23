The most successful federal law enforcement agency ever, the FBN was populated by some of the most amazing characters in American history, many of whom the author interviewed for this book. Working as undercover agents and with mercenary informers around the globe, these freewheeling Ã¢â‚¬Å“case-makingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ agents penetrated the Mafia and the French connection, breaking all the rules in the process, and uncovering the EstablishmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ties to organized crime. Targeted by the FBI and the CIA, the case-makers were, ironically, victims of their own fabulous success in hunting down societyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s predators. An incredible, never-before-told story, The Strength of the Wolf provides a new, exciting, and revealing look at an important chapter in American history.\n\n\nFormat: PDF\n\nThis file is fairly large for an ebook due to the fact that it is entirely composed of screen shots.
