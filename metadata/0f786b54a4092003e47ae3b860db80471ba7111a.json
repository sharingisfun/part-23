You never know what people are going to think when you release new music. All you can do is what comes from your heart and we feel like we have accomplished what we set out to do with these new songs. Hopefully our fans will feel the same passion for this album as we do.&quot; Bassist and vocalist Roger Lima added: &quot;this album's all new songs and new vibes, only recorded in our old school way.&quot;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/R5a6H3Z.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/R5a6H3Z.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f786b54a4092003e47ae3b860db80471ba7111a","amp;dn":"Less+Than+Jake+-+See+the+Light+%5B2013%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f786b54a4092003e47ae3b860db80471ba7111a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,120,107,84,164,9,32,3,228,122,227,184,96,219,128,71,27,167,17,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
