George Sanders stars as Vidocq, who spends most of the film as an aimless rogue willing to lie, cheat, and steal for his own comfort. The women who affect Vidocq's life include a saucy cabaret entertainer (Carole Landis) for whom Vidocq steals, and a good woman (Signe Hasso) for whom he straightens himself out. Fledgling director Douglas Sirk displayed his love of the Baroque (both in decor and characterizations) that would distinguish his later high-budget Universal soap operas. Most prints of A Scandal in Paris bear the film's alternate title, Thieves' Holiday. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0038908/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0038908/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nDirector:\nDouglas Sirk\nWriters:\nFranÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§ois-EugÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨ne Vidocq (memoirs)\nEllis St. Joseph (adaptation)\n\n\n        George Sanders\t ... \tEugÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©ne FranÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§ois Vidocq\n\tSigne Hasso\t... \tTherese De Pierremont\n\tCarole Landis\t... \tLoretta\n\tAkim Tamiroff\t... \tEmile Vernet\n\n\tGene Lockhart\t... \tPolice Chief Richet\n\n\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 01:35:34\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 384x288\nCodec : DivX (4 / 5 / 6)\nFPS : 25,00\nBitRate : 891 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,33 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 48000 Hz\nBitRate : 132 Kbps\n\n\n\nENJOY  AND  SEED\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2fecdce9ed0f5e40925694fa20935d1d1b01c18a","amp;dn":"A+Scandal+In+Paris+%281946%29++George+Sanders%2C+Carole+Landis","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2fecdce9ed0f5e40925694fa20935d1d1b01c18a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,236,220,233,237,15,94,64,146,86,148,250,32,147,93,29,27,1,193,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
