The rich-voiced alto has a touch of vibrato which she uses effectively. With a fine rhythm section consisting of pianist Ted Rosenthal, bassist Jay Leonhart, and drummer Victor Lewis, she mines the treasures of the Great American Songbook with a personal touch, showing off with a bit of effective scatting in &quot;What Is This Thing Called Love,&quot; and delivering a playful &quot;Comes Love&quot; that is complemented by Wycliffe Gordon's gritty, muted trombone, along with a suitably dreamy &quot;Lazy Afternoon.&quot; Callaway has a few surprises in store as well. She masters Chick Corea's demanding &quot;Spain&quot; with ease while she uncovers &quot;On My Way to You,&quot; a forgotten gem by Michel Legrand with lyrics by Marilyn &amp; Alan Bergman. She proves herself to be a talented songwriter with the soft bossa nova &quot;Save a Place for Me&quot; and the heartfelt &quot;Finding Beauty,&quot; both of which add guitarist Rodney Jones and Latin percussionist Emedin Rivera. There are some misfires. Joni Mitchell's quirky &quot;Carey&quot; is an ill fit with the rest of the album, while the dull, narrow range of rocker Stevie Nicks' &quot;Landslide&quot; simply doesn't suit Callaway's rich voice. But these tracks are minor glitches in an otherwise outstanding release.
