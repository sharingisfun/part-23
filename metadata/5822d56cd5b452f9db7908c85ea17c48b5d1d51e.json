This book draws on some of historyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s philosophical heavy hitters: Descartes, Kant, Karl Marx, and many more. Nineteen leather-clad chapters target with extreme prejudice the mysteries surrounding intriguing philosophical issues raised by the Terminator series, including the morality of terminating other people for the sake of peace, whether we can really use time travel to protect our future resistance leaders in the past, and if ArnoldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s famous T-101 is a real person or not.
