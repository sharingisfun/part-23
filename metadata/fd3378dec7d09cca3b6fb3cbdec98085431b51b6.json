Among the highpoints of the 1957 hard bop date are the original version of Bryant's popular &quot;Cubano Chant&quot; and strong renditions of two Thelonious Monk tunes (&quot;Off Minor&quot; and &quot;Well, You Needn't&quot;) cut just prior to the pianist/composer's discovery by the jazz public. Bryant is the most mature of the soloists, but the three horn players were already starting to develop their own highly individual sounds. The remaining track (a version of Jimmy Heath's &quot;C.T.A.&quot;) is played by the quartet of Taylor, tenor saxophonist John Coltrane, pianist Red Garland, and bassist Paul Chambers and is a leftover (although a good one) from another session.  \n\n\nTracklist:\n\n 01.
