Although these two songs have nothing else in common, the popularity of Prima's combination, and of David Lee Roth's 1985 cover version of the medley, has led to the mistaken perception by some that the songs are two parts of a single original composition.\n\nPrima's pairing of the two songs had its genesis in his 1950s Las Vegas stage show, during which he would revisit his old hits in a new, jive-and-jumping style, often presenting them in medleys. The success of that act gained Prima a recording deal with Capitol Records, which aimed to capture on record the atmosphere of his shows. The first album, titled The Wildest! and released in January 1957, opened with &quot;Just a Gigolo/I Ain't Got Nobody&quot;, which then became Prima's signature number and helped relaunch his career.\n\nDavid Lee Roth (often referred to as &quot;Diamond Dave&quot;) (born October 10, 1954, Bloomington, Indiana) is an American rock vocalist, songwriter, actor, author, and former radio personality, best known as the lead singer of Van Halen. In addition to his work with Van Halen, Roth is a successful solo artist and has released several platinum and gold solo albums. Roth rejoined Van Halen in 2007 for a North American tour that was the highest grossing tour in the band's history.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:90c1717195f26505578dd312d66962e5565e76b6","amp;dn":"David+Lee+Roth+-+Just+A+Gigolo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"90c1717195f26505578dd312d66962e5565e76b6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,193,113,113,149,242,101,5,87,141,211,18,214,105,98,229,86,94,118,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
