This three-part series explores famous and little known aspects of the Civil War, from the perspectives of the Union, the Confederacy and the millions of enslaved people struggling for freedom. Hosted by Ashley Judd, Trace Adkins, and Dennis Haysbert, all of whom had ancestors greatly affected by the war; this series delivers fresh insights and untold tales, brought to life through dramatic recreations and the Smithsonian Institution's vast collection of artifacts.\n\nPart 1: The Union\n=================\nWe all know who won the Civil War, but there were many moments when victory was anything but certain. Join Ashley Judd, great-great-great granddaughter of a Union soldier, as she takes us back 150 years for an intimate and comprehensive look at the North's battles and struggles during those bloody four years. From iconic artifacts like Old Glory to small objects like field medical kits and soldiers' photos, discover the stunning backstories of seemingly ordinary pieces from our past.\n\nPart 2: The Confederacy\n=======================\nSlave badges from South Carolina. Sheet music filled with boasts of triumph. The jewelry of the First Lady of the Confederacy. Smithsonian curators have collected thousands of Confederate objects from the Civil War, which collectively offer a rich understanding of the South's viewpoint during this pivotal era in American history. Join country music singer Trace Adkins, whose ancestors fought for the South, as he follows the rise and fall of the Confederacy, from the men who fought to define &quot;freedom&quot; on their own terms to those who were caught in the wake of war.\n\nPart 3: Fight for Freedom\n=========================\nA century and a half ago, North battled South in a conflict that would kill more Americans than any other war. The outcome would change our nation forever, and no one had more to gain, or to lose, than American slaves. Join actor Dennis Haysbert as he looks at their struggles through the objects in the Smithsonian's collection. From a child's shackles to the inkwell Lincoln used to write the Emancipation Proclamation, these artifacts transport us to a brutal and complicated time when our country tore itself apart.\n\nVideo\n-----\nID : 1\nFormat : AVC\nFormat/Info : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;5119383639111d657f60&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nFormat settings, CABAC : Yes\nFormat settings, ReFrames : 4 frames\nCodec ID : avc1\nCodec ID/Info : Advanced Video Coding\nDuration : 51mn 5s\nBit rate mode : Variable\nBit rate : 3 000 Kbps\nWidth : 1 280 pixels\nHeight : 720 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio : 16:9\nFrame rate mode : Constant\nFrame rate : 25.000 fps\nColor space : YUV\nChroma subsampling : 4:2:0\nBit depth : 8 bits\nScan type : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.130\nStream size : 1.06 GiB (95%)\nWriting library : x264 core 130 r2273 b3065e6\nEncoding settings : cabac=1 / ref=1 / deblock=1:0:0 / analyse=0x3:0x113 / me=hex / subme=2 / psy=1 / psy_rd=1.00:0.00 / mixed_ref=0 / me_range=16 / chroma_me=1 / trellis=0 / 8x8dct=1 / cqm=0 / deadzone=21,11 / fast_pskip=1 / chroma_qp_offset=0 / threads=3 / lookahead_threads=1 / sliced_threads=0 / nr=0 / decimate=1 / interlaced=0 / bluray_compat=0 / constrained_intra=0 / bframes=3 / b_pyramid=2 / b_adapt=1 / b_bias=0 / direct=1 / weightb=1 / open_gop=0 / weightp=1 / keyint=250 / keyint_min=25 / scenecut=40 / intra_refresh=0 / rc_lookahead=10 / rc=abr / mbtree=1 / bitrate=3000 / ratetol=1.0 / qcomp=0.60 / qpmin=0 / qpmax=69 / qpstep=4 / vbv_maxrate=62500 / vbv_bufsize=78125 / nal_hrd=none / ip_ratio=1.40 / aq=1:1.00\nEncoded date : UTC 2014-05-23 14:56:48\nTagged date : UTC 2014-05-23 15:59:03\nColor primaries : BT.709-5, BT.1361, IEC 61966-2-4, SMPTE RP177\nTransfer characteristics : BT.709-5, BT.1361\nMatrix coefficients : BT.709-5, BT.1361, IEC 61966-2-4 709, SMPTE RP177\n\nAudio\n-----\nID : 2\nFormat : AAC\nFormat/Info : Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat version : Version 4\nFormat profile : LC\nCodec ID : 40\nDuration : 51mn 5s\nBit rate mode : Variable\nBit rate : 160 Kbps\nMaximum bit rate : 296 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nChannel positions : Front: L R\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\nCompression mode : Lossy\nStream size : 58.5 MiB (5%)\nEncoded date : UTC 2014-05-23 14:56:48\nTagged date : UTC 2014-05-23 15:59:03","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:583502c610390022f500a1ac4be0e53c18f9e326","amp;dn":"Smithsonian+Channel+-+Civil+War+360+-+Series+1+%282013%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"583502c610390022f500a1ac4be0e53c18f9e326","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,53,2,198,16,57,0,34,245,0,161,172,75,224,229,60,24,249,227,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
