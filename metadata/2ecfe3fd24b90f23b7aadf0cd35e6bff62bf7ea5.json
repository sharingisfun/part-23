Almost two hours of music recorded over an intense ten week period last fall, Ghosts I-IV sprawls Nine Inch Nails across a variety of new terrain.\n\nNow that we\\\\\\&amp;#039;re no longer constrained by a record label, we\\\\\\&amp;#039;ve decided to personally upload Ghosts I, the first of the four volumes, to various torrent sites, because we believe BitTorrent is a revolutionary digital distribution method, and we believe in finding ways to utilize new technologies instead of fighting them.\n\nWe encourage you to share the music of Ghosts I with your friends, post it on your website, play it on your podcast, use it for video projects, etc.  It\\\\\\&amp;#039;s licensed for all non-commercial use under Creative Commons.\n\nWe\\\\\\&amp;#039;ve also made a 40 page PDF book to accompany the album.  If you\\\\\\&amp;#039;d like to download it for free, visit http://ghosts.nin.com/main/pdf\n\nGhosts I is the first part of the 36 track collection Ghosts I-IV.  Undoubtedly you\\\\\\&amp;#039;ll be able to find the complete collection on the same torrent network you found this file, but if you\\\\\\&amp;#039;re interested in the release, we encourage you to check it out at ghosts.nin.com, where the complete Ghosts I-IV is available directly from us in a variety of DRM-free digital formats, including FLAC lossless, for only $5.  You can also order it on CD, or as a deluxe package with multitrack audio files, high definition audio on Blu-ray disc, and a large hard-bound book.\n\nWe genuinely appreciate your support, and hope you enjoy the new music.  Thanks for listening.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://ghosts.nin.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://ghosts.nin.com&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2ecfe3fd24b90f23b7aadf0cd35e6bff62bf7ea5","amp;dn":"Nine+Inch+Nails+-+Ghosts+I+%282008%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2ecfe3fd24b90f23b7aadf0cd35e6bff62bf7ea5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,207,227,253,36,185,15,35,183,170,223,12,211,94,107,255,98,191,126,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
