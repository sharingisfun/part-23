The American housing market -- or, more sentimentally, the American dream -- began to collapse in 2006, taking with it large chunks of the global financial system. Millions of jobs worldwide have vanished forever. Did Bible prophecy predict this catastrophe? Are there biblical clues to how soon, if ever, a viable, long-term recovery can be sustained? Is the financial collapse just one of several signs that we are living in the final days of Earth's history In THE COMING ECONOMIC ARMAGEDDON, David Jeremiah says we can know the meaning behind what we see in the daily news -- and understand and prepare for living in the New Global Economy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe308544d7f45732dc256e027a206a66d0c6030d","amp;dn":"The+Coming+Economic+Armageddon","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe308544d7f45732dc256e027a206a66d0c6030d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,48,133,68,215,244,87,50,220,37,110,2,122,32,106,102,208,198,3,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
