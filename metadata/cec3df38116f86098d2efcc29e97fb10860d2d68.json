You stop aging at 25, but thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a catch: youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re genetically-engineered to live only one more year, unless you can buy your way out of it. The rich Ã¢â‚¬Å“earnÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ decades at a time (remaining at age 25), becoming essentially immortal, while the rest beg, borrow or steal enough hours to make it through the day. When a man from the wrong side of the tracks is falsely accused of murder, he is forced to go on the run with a beautiful hostage. Living minute to minute, the duoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s love becomes a powerful tool in their war against the system.\n\nInfo: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1637688/\nRelease Date: 28 October 2011 (USA)\nGenre: Action | Sci-Fi | Thriller\nStars: Justin Timberlake, Amanda Seyfried, Cillian Murphy\nQuality: BluRay 720p\nEncoder: FatNanda@Ganool\nSource: 720p.Bluray.x264.DTS-HDC\nSize: 750MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cec3df38116f86098d2efcc29e97fb10860d2d68","amp;dn":"In+Time+%282011%29+BluRay+720p+750MB+Ganool","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cec3df38116f86098d2efcc29e97fb10860d2d68","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,195,223,56,17,111,134,9,141,46,252,194,158,151,251,16,134,13,45,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
