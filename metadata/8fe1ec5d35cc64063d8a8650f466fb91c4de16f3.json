SuperDuper v2.6.3 is here, and it's compatible with Lion!\n\nSuperDuper is the wildly acclaimed program that makes recovery painless, because it makes creating a fully bootable backup painless. Its incredibly clear, friendly interface is understandable, easy to use, and SuperDuper's built-in scheduler makes it trivial to back up automatically. \n\nIt's the perfect complement to Time Machine under Leopard, Snow Leopard, and Lion, allowing you to store a bootable backup alongside your Time Machine volumeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and it runs beautifully on both Intel and Power PC Macs!\n\nSuperDuper's interface confirms all your actions in simple, clear language to ensure that the end result is exactly what you intended. Take a look, and click for additional screen shots!\n\nThe SuperDuper!\n\nWe all know that using the Macintosh is usually a trouble-free experience.\n\nExcept when it's not. Like when:\n\n* Your hard drive starts making that horrible clicking noise that signals an\n  imminent meltdown\n\n* A momentary lapse of coordination causes your MacBook Pro to take a\n  dirt nap\n\n* The system suddenly fails to boot\n\n* Your most important day-to-day application isn't working with the\n  system update you just applied\n\n* The new driver you just updated is causing your Macintosh to crash\n\n* That lousy software you just tried didn't come with an uninstaller, and\n  scattered files all over your drive\n\n* You need to restore a stable copy of your system, but don't want to lose\n  what you've been working on\n\n* You need to test new versions of the operating system with production\n  data you can't afford to lose\n\nIt happens to all of us, eventually. And recovering can be a painful, error-prone, time-wasting experience, if it's even possible at all. Until now.\n\n\nWhat new:\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Enhancements &amp; Bug Fixes\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Initial Mac OS X Lion support\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Scheduling usability improvements\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ SuperDuper! can eject and unmount internal drives after copy\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Improved handling of target volumes that disappear during copy\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ In-app support request now posts directly, rather than sending email\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Files that vanish between initial file copy and attribute update no longer\n  cancel copy\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ &quot;Backup on connect&quot; now works on 10.4 Tiger\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ The During Copy progress bar updates properly for drives larger than\n  1TB\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Very large nonstandard compressed files will copy without error\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Users will be warned when copying between volumes with different\n  case-sensitivity\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Additional I/O error detection handling during copies\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Files with the user append flag set are properly removed without error\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Drive selection is maintained if the user clicks Cancel\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ To simplify registration, SuperDuper! will swap the registration\n  username and key if necessary\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Files with the same name but different case are properly removed when\n  copying from a case insensitive to case sensitive volume\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Improved /Network exclusion logic upon error\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ /DamagedFiles, /lost+found and /cores are now excluded during copy\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Sandboxing now shares App Store and Facetime\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Symantec Antivirus files now excluded during copy\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Mozy cache and log files are excluded during copy\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Dynamic link loader maps are not longer copied\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Upgraded 3rd party frameworks to latest revision (e.g. Growl SDK to\n  1.2.1)\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Many other change\n\nSystem Requirements:\n\nOS version: Mac OS X 10.4 or later\n\n--- PLEASE SEED ---","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8fe1ec5d35cc64063d8a8650f466fb91c4de16f3","amp;dn":"SuperDuper+2.6.3+with+Core+Keygen","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8fe1ec5d35cc64063d8a8650f466fb91c4de16f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,225,236,93,53,204,100,6,61,138,134,80,244,102,251,145,196,222,22,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
