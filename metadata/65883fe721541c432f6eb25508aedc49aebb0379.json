This money represented the bulk of the K Foundation&amp;#039;s funds, earned by Drummond and Cauty as The KLF, one of the United Kingdom&amp;#039;s most successful pop groups of the early 1990s. The duo have never fully explained their motivations for the burning.\nThe incineration was recorded on a Hi-8 video camera by K Foundation collaborator Gimpo. In August 1995, the film?Watch the K Foundation Burn a Million Quid?was toured around the British Isles, with Drummond and Cauty engaging each audience in debate about the burning and its meaning. In November 1995, the duo pledged to dissolve the K Foundation and to refrain from public discussion of the burning for a period of 23 years.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_K_Foundation_burn_a_million_quid&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_K_Foundation_burn_a_million_quid&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:65883fe721541c432f6eb25508aedc49aebb0379","amp;dn":"Watch+the+K+Foundation+Burn+a+Million+Quid","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"65883fe721541c432f6eb25508aedc49aebb0379","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,136,63,231,33,84,28,67,47,110,178,85,8,174,220,73,174,187,3,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
