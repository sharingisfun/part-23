Kirito is asked by Kikuoka to investigate Gun Gale Online, specifically Death Gun, a weapon which seemed to link deaths in the virtual reality world to those in the real world.\n\nUpon entering the game, Kirito meets Sinon who teaches him the ropes of the game. They both enter the Gun Gale Online tournament, Bullet of Bullets. Kirito displays his amazing skills although he is only a newcomer to the game. Later, Kirito finds out that the mysterious deaths are linked to a red guild named Laughing Coffin in SAO.\n\nSource: SAO Wikia\n\nFormat                                   : MPEG-4\nDuration                                 : 23mn 40s\nBit rate                                 : 1 306 Kbps\nWidth                                    : 1 280 pixels\nHeight                                   : 720 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 16:9\n\nAudio:\n\nFormat                                   : AAC\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat profile                           : LC\nCodec ID                                 : 40\nDuration                                 : 23mn 40s\nBit rate mode                            : Variable\nBit rate                                 : 128 Kbps\nMaximum bit rate                         : 246 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nChannel positions                        : Front: L R\nSampling rate                            : 44.1 KHz\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCredits:\n\nVideo Source\t\t\t\t : Horriblesubs\nSubtitle Source\t\t\t\t : Horriblesubs\n\nThanks in advance to all people who will seed the torrent for as long as they can. ^_^\n\nFor more anime you might love visit as\n\n[image=b0Mkx6P2Qr]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d1f355ac76bba59e7be326d975fd02155bb15ea5","amp;dn":"%5BThund3r3mp3ror%5D+Sword+Art+Online+II+-+17.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d1f355ac76bba59e7be326d975fd02155bb15ea5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,243,85,172,118,187,165,158,123,227,38,217,117,253,2,21,91,177,94,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
