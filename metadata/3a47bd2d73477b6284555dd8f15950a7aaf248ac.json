His great book, On Nature, the world's first coherent philosophical treatise and touchstone for Plato, Aristotle, and Marcus Aurelius, has long been lost to history-but its surviving fragments have for thousands of years tantalized our greatest thinkers, from Montaigne to Nietzsche, Heidegger to Jung. Now, acclaimed poet Brooks Haxton presents a powerful free-verse translation of all 130 surviving fragments of the teachings of Heraclitus, with the ancient Greek originals beautifully reproduced en face.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a47bd2d73477b6284555dd8f15950a7aaf248ac","amp;dn":"Fragments","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a47bd2d73477b6284555dd8f15950a7aaf248ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,71,189,45,115,71,123,98,132,85,93,216,241,89,80,167,170,242,72,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
