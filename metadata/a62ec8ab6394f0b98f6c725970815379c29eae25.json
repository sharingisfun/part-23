Catherine falls in love with a handsome young army officer (William Eythe), who turns out to be an insurrectionist planning her downfall. At the last moment, Catherine relents, allowing the officer to escape with his true love, lady-in-waiting Anne Baxter. A bit too cute for its own good, Royal Scandal has some choice moments: Most notable are Tallulah Bankhead's pained reaction upon being hailed as &quot;The Mother of All Russias,&quot; and supporting actor Grady Sutton's southern-accented reference to the &quot;U-ral Mountains&quot;. \n\n   General\n      Complete name : Czarina.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      File size : 1.13 GiB\n      Duration : 1h 33mn\n      Overall bit rate : 1 726 Kbps\n      Writing application : FairUse Wizard - http://fairusewizard.com\n      Writing library : The best and REALLY easy backup tool\n   Video #0\n      ID : 0\n      Format : MPEG-4 Visual\n      Format profile : AdvancedSimple@L5\n      Format settings, BVOP : Yes\n      Format settings, QPel : No\n      Format settings, GMC : No warppoints\n      Format settings, Matrix : Default (MPEG)\n      Muxing mode : Packed bitstream\n      Codec ID : XVID\n      Codec ID/Hint : XviD\n      Duration : 1h 33mn\n      Bit rate : 1 524 Kbps\n      Width : 640 pixels\n      Height : 464 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 1.379\n      Frame rate : 23.976 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Colorimetry : 4:2:0\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.214\n      Stream size : 1 023 MiB (88%)\n      Writing library : XviD 1.2.0.dev47 (UTC 2006-11-01)\n   Audio #1\n      ID : 1\n      Format : AC-3\n      Format/Info : Audio Coding 3\n      Codec ID : 2000\n      Duration : 1h 33mn\n      Bit rate mode : Constant\n      Bit rate : 192 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Channel positions : L R\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Stream size : 129 MiB (11%)\n      Alignment : Split accross interleaves\n      Interleave, duration : 42 ms (1.00 video frame)\n      Interleave, preload duration : 500 ms\n\n\nIMDB: tt0038040\n\nEnglish audio; English, Spanish and Portuguese subtitles\n\nMy rip\n\nPreminger, Lubitsch - A Royal Scandal (1945) ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a62ec8ab6394f0b98f6c725970815379c29eae25","amp;dn":"Preminger%2C+Lubitsch+-+A+Royal+Scandal+%281945%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a62ec8ab6394f0b98f6c725970815379c29eae25","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,46,200,171,99,148,240,185,143,108,114,89,112,129,83,121,194,158,174,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
