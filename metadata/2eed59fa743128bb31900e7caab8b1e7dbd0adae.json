Blending jazz, funk, greek folk, byzantine, balcan, african rhythms and more, and balancing with mastery these elements, combing them with their spontaneity and humor - basic element in their work - they manage to show that tradition is alive and always developing and to create their distinct recognizable sound, a musical idiom of their own, fresh, well-crafted and finally downright radical.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.modeplagal.gr&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.modeplagal.gr&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nMode Plagal III\n\nUnlike its predecessors, whose material was mostly instrumental, &quot;Mode Plagal III&quot; features a formidable cast of some of the country&amp;#039;s finest female vocalists, Yiota Vei, Savina Yannatou, Eleni Tsaligopoulou and Theodosia Tsatsou.With the recording of their third album, Mode Plagal have completed 10 years of dealing, researching and experimenting on traditional greek music.
