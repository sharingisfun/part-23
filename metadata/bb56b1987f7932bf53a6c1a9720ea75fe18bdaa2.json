After her hippie British parents are murdered, Lilly is raised at a Sufi shrine in Morocco. As a young woman she goes on pilgrimage to Harar, Ethiopia, where she teaches QurÃ¢â‚¬â„¢an to children and falls in love with an idealistic doctor. But even swathed in a traditional headscarf, Lilly canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t escape being marked as a foreigner. Forced to flee Ethiopia for England, she must once again confront the riddle of who she is and where she belongs.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb56b1987f7932bf53a6c1a9720ea75fe18bdaa2","amp;dn":"Camilla+Gibb+-+Sweetness+in+the+Belly+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb56b1987f7932bf53a6c1a9720ea75fe18bdaa2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,86,177,152,127,121,50,191,83,166,193,169,114,14,167,95,225,139,218,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
