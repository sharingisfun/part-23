Packed with amazing raw footage, interviews and expert analysis, this is a high-octane trip in which dream getaways turn into nightmares.\n\n\n1)  1 \nIn this opening episode, a relaxing cruise around Liverpool's world-famous Albert Dock leaves one family fighting for survival after their vessel sinks in seconds with all 31 passengers still on board. A Dutch couple are trapped on an Italian beach when a huge wildfire cuts off their escape route and threatens to engulf them and over 4,000 fellow holidaymakers. A snowboarder enjoying a day out with his friends must fight for his life when he becomes trapped upside-down in an ice tomb. A Newcastle family regret booking their two-week break when a horrific mountain bike crash leaves a father with two broken arms. There is also amazing footage of a holidaymaker who loses his arm after a skydive goes disastrously wrong, a relaxing holiday in Cuba comes to an abrupt end for a British tourist when Hurricane Sandy strikes, and a group of friends are trapped beneath a flash flood in Utah. Finally, there is a heart-stopping moment when a US pensioner rolls her 4x4 down a steep gorge in Anza Borego Springs, California.\n\n2)  2 \nChaos erupts on a cruise liner in the Gulf of Mexico when a fire breaks out, causing massive power loss. Thousands of holidaymakers are stranded on board with food and water running out, backed-up toilets and sewage running down the corridors. Other holiday horrors this week include a group of friends crash-landing miles from anywhere in the wilds of the north-west USA, a climbing weekend which goes terribly wrong at 400ft and leaves two men fighting to survive, and a family looking on helplessly as their six-year-old son slams into a building while parasailing for the first time. Elsewhere, an 80-year-old pensioner's birthday treat looks like being her last when she slips out of her harness while skydiving at 13,000 feet, and a honeymoon is short-lived when a great white shark gets too close for comfort to a group of cage-diving holidaymakers. Also experiencing the holiday from hell, a family in Utah try to outrun a flash flood, a father and son find that their ski trip turns into an emergency rescue after a horrific collision, and a holidaymaker at a music festival in Germany witnesses it going wrong with fatal consequences.\n\n3)  Part 3 \nIn the last episode in the series, a family from Northampton take their four-year-old son on a weekend trip to London but face every parent's worst nightmare when their amphibious tour vehicle catches fire. Alone snowboarder falls into a deep tree well in California and is buried alive. A raging wildfire surrounds a group of men on a week-long hunting trip in Montana, while in Thailand a Swedish couple run for their lives to escape the Boxing Day tsunami. Closer to home, there is amazing footage of a British backpacker plummeting to the ground after a 300-metre base jump goes horribly wrong. A spear fisher in Florida has a close and terrifying encounter with a shark, and a runner and her family describe how their lives have been changed since the Boston marathon bombing.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img199.imageshack.us/img199/3103/biqg.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img199.imageshack.us/img199/3103/biqg.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img23.imageshack.us/img23/961/ya7h.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img23.imageshack.us/img23/961/ya7h.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img707.imageshack.us/img707/8919/xwta.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img707.imageshack.us/img707/8919/xwta.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img33.imageshack.us/img33/2039/jmgt.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img33.imageshack.us/img33/2039/jmgt.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img843.imageshack.us/img843/8900/fc62.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img843.imageshack.us/img843/8900/fc62.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img703.imageshack.us/img703/848/ylf4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img703.imageshack.us/img703/848/ylf4.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img836.imageshack.us/img836/1871/ynql.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img836.imageshack.us/img836/1871/ynql.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img543.imageshack.us/img543/9536/j7pp.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img543.imageshack.us/img543/9536/j7pp.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img811.imageshack.us/img811/6329/2njn.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img811.imageshack.us/img811/6329/2njn.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;89c1e0eee1c9c5bda7b8&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n * Video Bitrate: 3177 Kbps\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.778 (16:9)\n * Video Resolution: 1280x720\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 Kbps ABR 48KHz\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\n * Run-Time: 45mins\n * Framerate: 25 FPS\n * Number of Parts: 3\n * Container Mp4\n * Part Size: average 1,021 MB\n * Source: HDTV\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.stokesentinel.co.uk/World-s-Worst-Holiday-Horrors-TV-preview/story-20418908-detail/story.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.stokesentinel.co.uk/World-s-Worst-Holiday-Horrors-TV-preview/story-20418908-detail/story.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:99effd79bcb1f89b15ba88536814b1a15ebaa53d","amp;dn":"Channel+5+Worlds+Worst+Holiday+Horrors+3of3+x264+AAC+HDTV+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"99effd79bcb1f89b15ba88536814b1a15ebaa53d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,239,253,121,188,177,248,155,21,186,136,83,104,20,177,161,94,186,165,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
