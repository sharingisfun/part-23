For most of her life, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s had to take care of herself, her younger brother Chad, and her drunk mother. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lived under the shadow of what her father did when she was ten years old. Forever branded by his actions.\n\nCollege was her escape, she could get away and finally live. Her dream was to make it in the New York Ballet Company one day. That for her meant a long road full of hard work and dedication. She didn't have time for distractions, and Levi Klein was definitely a distraction.\n\nWill Levi be able to crack through her tough exterior and really see the wounded soul underneath? Becca needs to be loved, but the question is, will she let Levi love her?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:460bb1f44bf8ab443a2dd516d3c68abe8b817ac1","amp;dn":"The+Harder+I+Fall+by+Jessica+Gibson+epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"460bb1f44bf8ab443a2dd516d3c68abe8b817ac1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,11,177,244,75,248,171,68,58,45,213,22,211,198,138,190,139,129,122,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
