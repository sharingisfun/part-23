This year, however, neither their mother LÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©na nor their father Michel is accompanying them.  Instead, they are put into the care of Odette, the housemaid.  Unaware that their parents are on the point of separating, FrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©dÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©rique and Sophie settle into their usual holiday routine, amusing themselves with their cousins and playing practical jokes on all and sundry.  The girls are delighted when their mother arrives, but the absence of their father causes them some anxiety.  One day, LÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©na is surprised to find her lover, Jean-Claude, on the beach.  An aspiring artist, he is planning to start a new life in New York, and he invites LÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©na to join him... \n\nDirector: Diane Kurys \nScript: Diane Kurys, Alain Le Henry \nPhoto: Fabio Conversi, Giuseppe Lanci \nMusic: Philippe Sarde \nCast: Nathalie Baye (Lena), Richard Berry (Michel), Zabou Breitman (Bella), Jean-Pierre Bacri (LÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©on), Vincent Lindon (Jean-Claude), Valeria Bruni Tedeschi (Odette), Didier BÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©nureau (Ruffier), Julie Bataille (FrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©dÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©rique), Candice Lefranc (Sophie), Alexis Derlon (Daniel), Emmanuelle Boidron (Suzanne), Maxime Boidron (RenÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©), Benjamin Sacks (Till), Jean-Claude de Goros (L'aminateur) \nCountry: France \nLanguage: French \nRuntime: 110 min \n\nFile: La Baule-Les Pins (1990).avi\nFilesize: 681.33 Mb ( 714 430 464 bytes )\nPlay length: 01:33:12.959 (139824 frames)\nVideo: 720x304 (2.37:1), 25 fps, XviD Final 1.0.1 (build 35) ~912 kbps avg, 0.17 bit/pixel\nAudio: 48 kHz, MPEG Layer 3, 2 ch, ~96.00 kbps avg","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:360031c55192eb26536e50c9a3a08121db323dcc","amp;dn":"Le+baule-les+Pins+%281990%29+aka+C%5C%27est+la+vie+France+DVDrip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"360031c55192eb26536e50c9a3a08121db323dcc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,0,49,197,81,146,235,38,83,110,80,201,163,160,129,33,219,50,61,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
