Morrison's friend Steve Yeowell (of Zenith fame) did the art, while a behind-the-scenes Brendan McCarthy designed some of the looks and did the covers. Amazing talent for a story about a group of misfits murdering Skrulls left and right! Promotional info - &quot;See where two of Marvel's masters of mutantdom first made their mark! Grant Morrison and Mark Millar co-wrote this chilling story of murderous shape-changing criminals... and the menace they've sworn to cleanse from the Earth! Guest-starring Captain America and Nick Fury!&quot;\n\nThanks to AnPymGold-Empire for these digital copies, they look great! Please seed, and enjoy! :-)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5520cf51fe04206483b99a17392c97811a9ae1f2","amp;dn":"Skrull+Kill+Krew+01-05+%281995-1996%7CDigital%7CAnPymGold-Empire%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5520cf51fe04206483b99a17392c97811a9ae1f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,32,207,81,254,4,32,100,131,185,154,23,57,44,151,129,26,154,225,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
