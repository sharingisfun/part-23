The Colour And The Shape was\nthe first Foo FightersÃƒÆ’? album recorded as a band.\nBassist Nate Mendel and guitarist Pat Smear had\ntoured with Grohl following the 1995 release of\neponymous debut, &amp;#039;Foo Fighters&amp;#039;, but hadnÃƒÆ’?t\ncontributed to the recording. Gil Norton - already\nlegendary for his work with the Pixies, among others\n- elevated the &amp;#039;The Colour And The Shape&amp;#039; sessions\nfrom the DIY approach of &amp;#039;Foo Fighters&amp;#039; - and the\narrival of drummer Taylor Hawkins, following the\nrecording of the album, completed the groupÃƒÆ’?s\nevolution from ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´projectÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ to ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´bandÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶.\nMost important were the songs. &amp;#039;Monkey Wrench&amp;#039; , &amp;#039;My\nHero&amp;#039;, &amp;#039;Everlong&amp;#039; &amp;, latterly, &amp;#039;Walking After You&amp;#039;\nwere all UK hits. It was this parade of hits that\nput Foo FightersÃƒÆ’? on the path to becoming the\nGrammy-winning, festival-headlining, indiscriminate\nass-kicking machine that we know ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â» and love - today.\nNow in 2007, Foo FightersÃƒÆ’? celebrate the tenth\nbirthday of this landmark album with the release of\na special anniversary digipack edition featuring new\nliner notes along with SIX bonus tracks. Gil Norton\ntook a break from production of the Autumn release\nof the new Foo FightersÃƒÆ’? studio album to help\nsupervise the audio remastering of the disc, and the\nFoos are proud to present this glimpse at their -\nmake that our - rock and roll past.\nThe bonus tracks include some UK-centric covers,\nincluding Killing JokeÃƒÆ’?s &amp;#039;Requiem&amp;#039;, Gary NumanÃƒÆ’?s\n&amp;#039;Down In The Park&amp;#039; and Gerry RaffetyÃƒÆ’?s &amp;#039;Baker\nStreet&amp;#039;.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cce5a5aa107bc303efccb5cde878f9aae11f5628","amp;dn":"Foo_Fighters-The_Colour_And_The_Shape-%2810th_Anniversary_Special_","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cce5a5aa107bc303efccb5cde878f9aae11f5628","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,229,165,170,16,123,195,3,239,204,181,205,232,120,249,170,225,31,86,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
