Norseman's Bride\n\nIngeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s first solo venture, Shipwrecks &amp; Static is an eccentric marriage between melodic instruments and the bleeps and squeaks of electronic tomfoolery. Inge wrote, recorded and produced the bulk of the album and is joined here by the angelic voice of Heidi Talbot, the edgy guitars of Brighton based Tom Cook and a cameo appearance of Martin Green of award winning diddle-superstars Lau.\n\nHailing from the microscopic, isolated Shetland island of Fair Isle, Inge Thomson grew up in an enormous world of music. Her family are prominent exponents of folk and traditional music and she became involved with a piano keyed accordion at an early age, which eventually led on to even less socially acceptable instruments.\n\nInge cut her gigging teeth with folk-pop quintet ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Drop The BoxÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ who toured steadily through the 1990s. More recently she toured and recorded with contempo/trad band ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Harem ScaremÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ winning critical acclaim for her songwriting and vocal prowess. A recent collaboration with Will ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBonnie Prince BillyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Oldham cumulated in an album which received 5 stars in both ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“MojoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“UncutÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ magazines. Currently Inge brings her innovative vocal harmonies and multi-instrumental textures to the Karine Polwart Trio.\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b32f60a6abc150dfc42832da83cf36e7519d85d5","amp;dn":"Inge+Thompson...Shipwrecks+%26amp%3B+Static%282010%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b32f60a6abc150dfc42832da83cf36e7519d85d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,47,96,166,171,193,80,223,196,40,50,218,131,207,54,231,81,157,133,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
