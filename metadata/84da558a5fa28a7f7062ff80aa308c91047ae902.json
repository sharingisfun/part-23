In 234 essays, arranged alphabetically from &quot;Ageashi / Tripping on Your Own Tongue&quot; to &quot;Zenrei / Breaking the Molds of the Past&quot;. Long term expatriate and internationally renowned expert on Japan, Boye Lafayette De Mente offers personal insights into the extremes of Japanese behavior and into the dynamics of one of the world's most fascinating societies.\r\n\r\nKAT - C4dr\r\nTBP - shailab\r\n\r\nBTC - 1CZ4nTozpgfgqufWhiXDtBu9pVurd41SPz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:84da558a5fa28a7f7062ff80aa308c91047ae902","amp;dn":"Japan%27s+Cultural+Code+Words+233+key+Boye+Lafayette+De+Mente+C4dr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"84da558a5fa28a7f7062ff80aa308c91047ae902","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,218,85,138,95,162,138,127,112,98,255,128,170,48,140,145,4,122,233,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
