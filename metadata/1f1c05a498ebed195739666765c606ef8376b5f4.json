When fifty-four-year-old Julianna Dapper slips out of a mental hospital in Bangor, Maine, on a June day in 1962, it's with one purpose in mind. Julianna knows she must go back to the tiny farming community in northern Missouri where she was born and raised. It's the place where she and her best friend, Ben Taylor, roamed as children, and where her life's course shifted irrevocably one night long ago.\n\nEmbarking on her journey, Julianna meets Elijah Hunter, a shy teenaged African-American boy, and Jon Tate, a young hitchhiker on the run from the law. The three become traveling companions, bound together by quirks of happenstance. And even as the emerging truth about Julianna's past steers them inexorably toward tragedy, their surprising bond may be the means to transform fear and heartache into the strength that finally guides Julianna home.\n\nThe Third Hill North of Town is a haunting, imaginative story of human connection and coincidenceÃ¢â‚¬â€a poignant and powerful novel that ripples with wit and heart.\n\n&quot;A brilliant combination of chaos and coincidence. With fresh language and uniquely imperfect characters, Noah Bly weaves a story of a cross-country trek that is both improbable and believable. This fresh, engrossing novel left me convinced of the power of memory, even as it arises from a disturbed mind, and taught meÃ¢â‚¬â€as Bly promisesÃ¢â‚¬â€the wisdom of faith in the ridiculous.&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€Anna Jean Mayhew, author of The Dry Grass of August\n\n&quot;This is an eerie, haunting, beautifully realized novel populated by charming misfits and eccentrics.&quot; --Joseph Olshan, author of Cloudland\n\nGenre: General Fiction/Classics","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f1c05a498ebed195739666765c606ef8376b5f4","amp;dn":"The+Third+Hill+North+of+Town+by+Noah+Bly","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f1c05a498ebed195739666765c606ef8376b5f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,28,5,164,152,235,237,25,87,57,102,103,101,198,6,239,131,118,181,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
