While most of the new troops will head to the volatile south of the country, a new frontline, operating almost under the radar of NATO, is encircling the north of the country.\n\n\n\nThe insurgents are aiming to take over the countryside surrounding the towns and cities and to block the main supply route, the Kunduz-Baghlan road, which services coalition troops across much of Afghanistan since the traditional route through Pakistan became too treacherous.\n\n\n\nDispatches goes inside the enemy camp in northern Afghanistan as award-winning Afghan reporter Najibullah Quraishi is granted access to an army of extreme Islamic combatants.\n\n\n\n\n\nFile Name: dispatches.
