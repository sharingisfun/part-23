Produced by Danger Mouse (Gnarls Barkley, Gorillaz) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ a like-minded devotee of obscure psychedelia, the album radiates charm, imagination, and scintillating melodies.\n\nLast summer, Andrew Pettit, David Farrell and Ulrika Bjorsne decamped from South East London to California minus a record deal or any funding to speak of with only their self-belief and the ton of goodwill generated by their much-loved debut ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“The Debt CollectionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ for company. At the invitation of the aforementioned Danger Mouse, The Shortwave Set went to work in Los Angeles last June, where they wasted no time in availing themselves of the string arranging talents of Van Dyke Parks (legendary Beach Boys collaborator) and the distinctive soundscapes and atmospherics of The Velvet UndergroundÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s John Cale.\n\nThe resulting album ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Replica Sun MachineÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ is the psychedelic pop adventure of the year, where acid-bright sunshine casts eerie shadows and illuminates uncomfortable truths. It&amp;#039;s an impossible-to-get-out-off-your-head trip, like a European Flaming Lips inspired by the baroque pop of the Left Banke, the cinematic scope of Serge Gainsbourg and the discomforting drama of Nico&amp;#039;s solo albums.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9cf8b30c03506516ab6cce3d8033b98b01b015d0","amp;dn":"The+Shortwave+Set+-+Replica+Sun+Machine+%28Prod.+by+Danger+Mouse%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9cf8b30c03506516ab6cce3d8033b98b01b015d0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,248,179,12,3,80,101,22,171,108,206,61,128,51,185,139,1,176,21,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
