Giant Step/De Ole Folks At Home from 1969 was Taj's commercial high point, and it's easy to understand why. The first half of the album (originally released as a two-record set) features Taj and band blending rock, pop and blues on songs like &quot;Take a Giant Step,&quot; &quot;Give Your Woman What She Wants&quot; and &quot;Good Morning Little Schoolgirl.&quot; The second half is more laid-back and down-home, with Taj essaying solo renditions of &quot;Fishing Blues,&quot; &quot;Stagger Lee&quot; and &quot;Light Rain Blues&quot; on banjo, harmonica and acoustic guitar. The most effortlessly enjoyable record of an effortlessly enjoyable career.&quot;  \n\n&quot;If you've never heard him before, it's hard to describe Taj's music. He's usually labelled as a blues man - but his music is a mixture of all kinds of folk traditions - including american, african, and caribbean. I've seen him live several times - he's intelligent, articulate, warm, and has a great sense of humor. He plays a wide range of instruments - most often guitar or banjo. There is something truly special about him. His songs are usually playful and infectious - you just can't help tappin' your toes and humming along. He's recorded a number of great albums, but Giant Step has always been my favorite. The CD includes both albums in the original vinyl release, Giant Step and De Ole Folks At Home. On Giant Step, Taj is backed by a small group of electric blues musicians (featuring Jesse Ed Davis on lead guitar). On the more down-home De Ole Folks At Home, he plays solo, accompanying himself on guitar, banjo, and harmonica. My favorite song is &quot;Take a Giant Step&quot; - it's a tender look at rediscovering love. There's something about this song that captures Taj's essence - it's simple and direct and honest. Taj is a unique soul - his music always makes me feel good.&quot;\n\nBrought to you by TQMP.
