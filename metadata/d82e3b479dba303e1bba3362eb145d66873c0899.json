Rachel's best friend, Calla Mackie (Estelle Parsons), invites her to attend a religious revival meeting. Here Rachel is swept up in the emotional fervor orchestrated by a young guest preacher (Terry Kiser). This is the first of several cathartic incidents which convince Rachel to kick over the traces and express her own needs and emotions. She has a brief sexual liaison with an old family friend (James Olson), and is delighted at the notion that she might have become pregnant. Rachel ends up alone and childless (her &quot;pregnancy&quot; was nothing more than a benign cyst), but still determined to forge a new life for herself. Based the novel A Jest of God by Margaret Laurence, Rachel, Rachel won New York Film Critics awards for both Joanne Woodward and Paul Newman, and an Oscar nomination for Joanne Woodward. \n \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063483/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063483/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nSubs:Only Fr\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.5sub.com/movie.aspx?m=96589699-f1c2-4f6f-9c66-cc319a927c42&amp;k=rachel&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.5sub.com/movie.aspx?m=96589699-f1c2-4f6f-9c66-cc319a927c42&amp;k=rachel&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nDirector:Paul Newman\n\n\n\n Joanne Woodward ...
