The volume brings together ten essays, which examine four issues in American art: portraiture and realism in relation to abstract expressionism, the implications of color, the role of narrative, and the concept of multiple originals. Each essay makes the intentional effort to de-race African American artâ€”not to strip the work of its idiomatic cultural footing, but rather to situate it within the larger picture of the nationâ€™s history and cultural traditions","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0666c34e82ef20e2c74748098f4ee9e07e2c2837","amp;dn":"A+Century+of+African+American+Art+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0666c34e82ef20e2c74748098f4ee9e07e2c2837","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,102,195,78,130,239,32,226,199,71,72,9,143,78,233,224,126,44,40,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
