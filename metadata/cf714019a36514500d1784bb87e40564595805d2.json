What's up with these premier tickets?\n\nP.S. There's a new ending in a few weeks.\n\n\n---\n\nYou are free to do whatever you like with this file, and upload it wherever you want, etc! Just make sure you give credit to Kitsunekko, the RAW as well as myself. Oh and please make sure the website doesn't have questionable content on it, I'd like to remain as family-friendly as possible, to remain safe to all types of viewers! Also, refrain from uploading to sites that make money off of these, making money off of someone else's intellectual property isn't right at all. Other than that, I encourage you to upload wherever you want. The broader the audience, the better. \n\nThese are 100% non-profit subs of an OTA program. Don't pay for non-official subs! I don't own anything pertaining to PokÃƒÂ©mon, I'm just a fan doing fan things.\n\nP.S. I'm sure a lot of Conan fans are excited for Lupin III vs Detective Conan: The Movie. But for the same reason I changed my mind about subbing Conan's movie 17, I will not be doing that one either unfortunately. Same goes for any other non-TV specials or movies.\n\n---\n\nSee you on Thursday for PokÃƒÂ©mon XY 08. Saturday for Detective Conan 720.\n\nOh, and PokÃƒÂ©mon XY is on a break starting 23/12/13 and ending on 09/01/13. There is also a break on 23/01/13. Conan will be on break on 28/12/13, following two manga-based episodes.\n\nEnjoy the episode, and depending on where you're from -- enjoy the holiday season!
