The first series, written by Marv Wolfman, and illustrated by Gene Colan began in 1982. It was considered by many fans DC's answer to Marvel Comics' Tomb of Dracula. The second series began in 1996 was one of four book that made up DC's Weirdoverse group of titles.\nThe main character of both series was Baron Winters, a sorcerer who would assemble a team of chosen individuals to fight supernatural threats. The Baron himself did not participate in the missions and would manipulate, sometimes unethically, others to do so for him. This was because, for reasons not revealed, he could not leave Wintersgate Manor, the labyrinthine mansion in Washington, D.C., where he lived. The mansion was located in a special juncture of time and space, allowing him to send his team to different places and times.\n\nNot my scans.
