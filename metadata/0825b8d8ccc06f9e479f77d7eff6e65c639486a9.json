Wherever one stands on that issue, the fact remains that Marley's early work, particularly the sessions with producer Lee &quot;Scratch&quot; Perry in 1970 and 1971, are of an uncommonly high quality. This collection combines several of the Perry tracks (&quot;The Sun Is Shining,&quot; &quot;Duppy Conqueror,&quot; &quot;African Herbsman,&quot; &quot;Mr. Brown&quot;) with those produced by Leslie Kong (&quot;Soul Shakedown Party&quot;) and by the Wailers themselves (&quot;Trench Town Rock,&quot; &quot;Lively Up Yourself,&quot; both of which were originally released on the group's own Tuff Gong label), and the selections are enough to provide a brief but decent introduction to this Jamaican phase of Marley's career. There are literally hundreds of editions of this material on the market -- some legally licensed, some not -- but Roots of a Legend is at least honestly rendered, with decent packaging and sound. A bonus DVD featuring footage from Marley's 1980 tour (undertaken just 17 months before his death) in support of the Survival album is also included. ~ Steve Leggett This DVD/CD set captures the best of both Marley's early and late years. The DVD captures Marley at his popular peak in brilliant live performances of 10 of his later hits, filmed at the height of his 1978 US tour. The CD celebrates his crucial early period, from 1969 onwards, with 21 tracks. This release includes a bonus DVD. Bob Marley: Bob Marley (vocals, guitar); Aston Barrett (bass instrument); Carlton &quot;Carly&quot; Barrett (drums).
