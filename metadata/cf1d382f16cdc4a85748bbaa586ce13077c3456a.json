Though early on categorized as a trip hop group, they quickly expanded their sound to the point where they could no longer be described as a lone genre, but rather encompass alternative, electronica, electropop, rock, and mixture of others. The band originally called themselves Hoover, but later changed their name to Hooverphonic after discovering other groups were already using the Hoover name and to avoid any legal issues with the vacuum cleaner company.\r\n\r\n+Members\t\r\nAlex Callier\r\nRaymond Geerts\r\n\r\n+Past members\t\r\nFrank DuchÃªne\r\nLiesje Sadonius\r\nKyoko Bartsoen\r\nEsther Lybeert\r\nGeike Arnaert\r\nNoÃ©mie Wolfs\r\n\r\n*Albums*:\r\n\r\nA New Stereophonic Sound Spectacular (1997)\r\nBattersea (EP) (1998)\r\nBlue Wonder Power Milk (1998)\r\nThe Magnificent Tree (2000)\r\nPresents Jackie Cane (2002)\r\nSit Down and Listen to Hooverphonic (2003)(Live)\r\nNo More Sweet Music (2005)\r\nSingles '96 - '06 (2006)\r\nThe President Of The LSD Golf (2007)\r\nThe Night Before (2010)\r\nHooverphonic with Orchestra (2012)(LIVE)\r\nReflection (2013)\r\nWonderLand (2016)\r\n\r\n*Live Rarities and Acoustic* \r\n\r\nDour Festival 1999 \r\nAcoustic lives 1999\r\n@PureFm 2007/20013\r\nlives 2007,2008, 2012, 2016*\r\nLive Club 69 \r\ncovers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf1d382f16cdc4a85748bbaa586ce13077c3456a","amp;dn":"Hooverphonic+discography","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf1d382f16cdc4a85748bbaa586ce13077c3456a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,29,56,47,22,205,196,168,87,72,187,170,88,108,225,48,119,195,69,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
