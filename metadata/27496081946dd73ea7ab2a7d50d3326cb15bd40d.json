Who knows what causes it? All *I* know is that it takes a very special 2nd album to keep the masses coming back for a second helping. The mighty rockers known as Foreigner, led by the unique, powerful voice of Lou Gramm, and the masterful guitar &amp; vocals of Mick Jones, avoided the sophomore jinx just fine, thank you very much, with their 2nd album, 1978's &quot;Double Vision,&quot; which sold even more copies than their self-titled debut from the previous year. It's all about quality, folks: &quot;Double Vision&quot; is another great album of melodic rock as only Foreigner can do it. Great stuff all over the place on this one: the classic head-bobbers &quot;Hot Blooded,&quot; the title song, and &quot;Blue Morning, Blue Day,&quot; and wonderful ballads like &quot;You're All I Am,&quot; &quot;Back Where You Belong&quot; &amp; &quot;I Have Waited So Long.&quot; There's even a strong, rare Foreigner instrumental, &quot;Tramontane,&quot; and more kick-butt numbers like &quot;Love Has Taken It's Toll,&quot; &quot;Lonely Children,&quot; and the awesome finale, &quot;Spellbinder.&quot;....Featuring top-notch, catchy tunes from end to end, and performed to perfection by the band, Foreigner's &quot;Double Vision&quot; is an instant rock classic.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nForeigner - Double Vision\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Foreigner\nAlbum................: Double Vision\nGenre................: Pop/Rock\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1978\n\nFLAC\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.2.1 20070917\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: 62 %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\n\nMP3 V0 (Highest Quality Available For MP3)\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: LAME 3.99\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Extreme, (avg. bitrate: 264kbps)\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.
