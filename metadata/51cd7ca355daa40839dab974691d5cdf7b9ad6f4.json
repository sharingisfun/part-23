It looks wicked, and the physics are awesome ? it feels totally real to drive.\n\nThis is one of my favourite racing games ever, it's fun but it gets pretty hard.\nI've incuded Xpadder with a profile for the Xbox360 controller.\n\nI highly recommend using a gamepad, but each to their own.\n\nNo major rig required to play this game as it came out in 1998, but has very nice graphics if you keep it the way I have set it up.\n\nOS: Windows XP / Vista / 7 \n\nNote:\n\nI have included my own music to bump up the atmosphere of the game, but I've included the original soundtracks as well.\n\nWiki:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerslide_(video_game)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerslide_(video_game)&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIGN Rating:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://au.ign.com/games/powerslide/pc-3124&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://au.ign.com/games/powerslide/pc-3124&lt;/a&gt;\n\nMy Screens:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/EAjLaaaFE&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/EAjLaaaFE&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nPlease seed for others .... :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:51cd7ca355daa40839dab974691d5cdf7b9ad6f4","amp;dn":"Powerslide","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"51cd7ca355daa40839dab974691d5cdf7b9ad6f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,205,124,163,85,218,164,8,57,218,185,116,105,29,92,223,123,154,214,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
