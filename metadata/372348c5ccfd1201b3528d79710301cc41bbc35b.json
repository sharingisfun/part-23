This Web companion to the four-part series takes a close look at the primal instinct that causes animals to come together in order to pass along their genes to the next generation. We also examine how timing can be key in the mating process, and how varied sex contracts create not only new life, but diversity, in both animals and humans.\n\n\n\n2)  A Time and a Place \nThere is nothing more romantic than a moonlit night. So goes many a love song. But for animals from bat rays to wriggling, seagoing palolo worms, the moon is more than a romantic backdrop -- it's a key signal that the time has come to mate. Such sexual signals are the focus of A TIME AND A PLACE, Part 2 of NATURE's THE NATURE OF SEX. From the changing phases of the moon to subtle chemical surges, the program outlines the many cues that trigger sexual activity. Indeed, without these landmarks, many animals would send their newborns into the world at the wrong place and wrong time, with little chance of survival.\n\n\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img19/2526/natureofsexscreen0.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img19/2526/natureofsexscreen0.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: Xvid\n * Video Bitrate: 1660kb/s\n * Video Resolution: 640x480\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 4:3\n * Audio Codec: MP3\n * Audio BitRate: 128kb/s\n * Audio Channels: 2\n * RunTime Per Part: 55min\n * Number Of Parts: 6\n * Part Size: 700MB\n * Ripped by JumpinS\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Official Website\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:372348c5ccfd1201b3528d79710301cc41bbc35b","amp;dn":"PBS+The+Nature+of+Sex+2of6+A+Time+and+a+Place+Xvid-MP3+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"372348c5ccfd1201b3528d79710301cc41bbc35b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,35,72,197,204,253,18,1,179,82,141,121,113,3,1,204,65,187,195,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
