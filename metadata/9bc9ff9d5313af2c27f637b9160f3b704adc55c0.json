Studios\nPublication Date:  December 26, 2012\n\nWritten by Paul Jenkins\nArt by Carlos Magno\nColors by Michael Garland\nLetters by Ed Dukeshire\nCover A by Whilce Portacio and Blond\n\nThe superhero battle royale you can't get from Marvel or DC! A powerful and mysterious supervillain has imprisoned the world's greatest superheroes, forcing them to fight to the death until there is but one victor. It's kill or be killed as we settle the score on all those hypothetical superhero match-ups in the ultimate Deathmatch. Written by industry legend Paul Jenkins (Sentry, Inhumans) and drawn by comics superstar Carlos Magno (Planet of the Apes, Transformers), Deathmatch is a dark, psychological deconstruction of the superhero genre that can't be missed.\n\nThanks goes to Re-em for this release.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9bc9ff9d5313af2c27f637b9160f3b704adc55c0","amp;dn":"Deathmatch+1+%282012%29+%28c2c%29+%28Re-em-Novus%29+%5BNVS-D%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9bc9ff9d5313af2c27f637b9160f3b704adc55c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,201,255,157,83,19,175,44,39,246,55,185,22,15,59,112,74,220,85,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
