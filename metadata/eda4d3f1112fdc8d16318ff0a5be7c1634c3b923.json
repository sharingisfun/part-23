The authors tackle this problem by solving abstract equations \nover a language. The most general solutions are studied when both synchronous and parallel composition operators are used. \nThe abstract equations are specialized to languages associated with important classes of automata used for modeling systems. \nThe book is a blend of theory and practice, which includes a description of a software package with applications to sequential synthesis of \nfinite state machines. Specific topologies interconnecting the components, exact and heuristic techniques, and optimization scenarios are studied. \nFinally the scope is enlarged to domains like testing, supervisory control, game theory and synthesis for special omega languages. \nThe authors present original results of the authors along with an overview of existing ones.\n\nPLZ SEED WHILE AND AFTER DOWNLOADING...\n\n&quot;SHARING IS CARING&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eda4d3f1112fdc8d16318ff0a5be7c1634c3b923","amp;dn":"The+Unknown+Component+Problem-+Theory+and+Applications%5BTeam+Nanb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eda4d3f1112fdc8d16318ff0a5be7c1634c3b923","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,164,211,241,17,47,220,141,22,49,143,240,165,190,124,22,52,195,185,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
