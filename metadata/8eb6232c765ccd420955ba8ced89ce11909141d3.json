Simple, one-step tools let users quickly draw shapes, add graphics, arrange and align objects, rotate objects and add designer special effects. There are more than 30 shapes with individual controls to help users create logos and custom design elements. Built-in rulers, project grid lines, snap-to-grid, real-time alignment guides and full zoom capabilities make positioning objects a breeze.\n\nBusiness Card Shop can import logos, photos and clip art in popular formats. A built-in Scrapbook lets users store favorite graphics, shapes, and text for quick and easy future reuse. The Scrapbook even remembers any special formatting or attributes applied to an object such as font, stroke color, transparency, masks, etc.\n\nWhat's New\n\n* Fixed problem introduced in 4.5.1 that could cause software to \n  crash under OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard\n\nVersion 4.5.1:\n\n* NEW!
