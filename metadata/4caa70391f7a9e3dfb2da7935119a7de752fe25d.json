The courses are available a choice of SOFTWARE (PC and Mac), AUDIO CD, or MP3 AUDIO formats.\n\nThe SOFTWARE versions allow you to hear the correct pronunciation of each word when it is first presented (as in the demo above), as well as seeing the text presented on screen. The AUDIO and MP3 AUDIO versions allow you to listen to the entire course in the car, on a personal CD player, or on an MP3 player like the Apple iPod etc. Please see futher below for a demo of the audio course.\n\nThe software, audio, or MP3 audio versions are equally effective courses on their own as they teach the same vocabulary and grammar. However, for those who wish to have the convenience of seeing the text and hearing pronunciation of each word from the software course, and also listening to the entire course while away from your computer with an audio course, the different versions are highly complementary. Many people learn first by using the software, then revise by listening to audio versions.\n\nThe software and MP3 audio versions are available on CD by post, or can be downloaded immediately after payment. This allows you to start learning within minutes wherever you are in the World, and at additional discount (please see the &amp;#039;Special Offers&amp;#039; on the right of the page). Audio CD courses are available on CD by post only.\n\nThe Level 1 software or audio course allows you to learn an extensive vocabulary and basic grammar in just 10-12 hours - about 3 times faster than you would take using conventional learning methods!! This will enable you to communicate effectively in Italian in EMERGENCIES, at the RESTAURANT, at the HOTEL, at WORK etc etc. Levels 2, 3 and 4 courses extend your learning using exactly the same approach, so by the time you finish you will be able to read and understand the average newspaper, and speak and understand Italian in a very wide range of situations.\n\nPrintable course vocabulary glossaries are provided with all courses.\n\n\n\n\nItalian Level 1 course\n\nLinkword language coursesA large number of independent studies have shown the method used in Linkword courses is up to 3x faster than normal learning methods.
