It was released as a double LP in 1972. Roadwork was the second of only three albums the band recorded together.\n\nHighlights include Winter's virtuoso keyboard and vocal work, and the guitar stylings of Rick Derringer. The longest track on the album was the band's own version of the John D. Loudermilk song, &quot;Tobacco Road&quot;, which lasted over 17 minutes, taking up an entire side of the album. Derringer contributed lead vocals to &quot;Still Alive and Well&quot; and &quot;Back in the USA&quot;, and Johnny Winter made a special appearance singing lead on &quot;Rock and Roll, Hoochie Koo&quot;. Louisiana native Jerry LaCroix, who shared lead vocals with Winter in White Trash, is also prominently featured.\n\nThe album was recorded before live audiences at the Apollo Theater in New York and in Los Angeles at the legendary Whisky a Go Go night club.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n    &quot;Save the Planet&quot; (Jerry LaCroix, Edgar Winter) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 7:39\n    &quot;Jive, Jive, Jive&quot; (La Croix, Winter) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:12\n    &quot;I Can't Turn You Loose&quot; (Otis Redding) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:55\n    &quot;Still Alive and Well&quot; (Rick Derringer) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:03\n    &quot;Back in the U.S.A.&quot; (Chuck Berry) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:48\n    &quot;Rock &amp; Roll, Hoochie Koo&quot; (Derringer) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:42\n    &quot;Tobacco Road&quot; (John D.
