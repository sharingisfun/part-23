Music has iTunes. But when it comes to PDFs, you're on your own. That is, until now. Now there is Yep and there's no looking back.\n\nStart Yep for the first time and it automatically shows you all your PDFs tagged based on where they were found on your hard disk. But the real fun begins when you start adding your own tags. You'll never go back to a hierarchical filing system again.\n\nAnd you might even think that iPhoto, iTunes and the Finder could learn a thing or two from Yep.\n\nFeatures\n\nTrack thousands of documents\nView and open PDF files\n\nSystem Requirements\n\nOS version: Mac OS X 10.4.10 (Tiger) or later\n\n--- PLEASE SEED ---","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7dd3f4b82e9d4a6678fcae03d81fb23cae455214","amp;dn":"Yep+1.8.0+reupload+by+request+%2B+sn","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7dd3f4b82e9d4a6678fcae03d81fb23cae455214","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,211,244,184,46,157,74,102,120,252,174,3,216,31,178,60,174,69,82,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
