That's DC, Vertigo (ugghh!)Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â®, Wildstorm, Helix, Milestone, Minx, Paradox, Piranha, Tangent, America's Best Comics, Cliffhanger, CMX, Homage, Humanoids, and MC.Gaines among others.\n       Plus, for characters and titles DC picked up from other companies, as much of those &quot;Pre-DC&quot; comics as I can find. This includes many major and minor DC superheroes, war comics, romance comics and various licensed characters such as Tarzan, Star Trek, Loony Toons, Scooby-Doo etc. A few of the heros include Shazam!, Blue Beetle, Plastic Man, Gen13, The Web, The Shield, Phantom Lady, Captain Atom and many more. There may be a lot of things you didn't know started with a different company. There will some &quot;Post DC&quot; comics of characters like Fallen Angel that have moved on. But that will be arbitrarily selective on my part. Assorted related material will be included. It's going to be c.875-885gb in total. It will take as long as it takes. I've already done a 600+gb subset of this in an earlier project (MTCDC). So clearly, I'm insane, which is what you look for in a guy promising this. So here we go again, but bigger.\n\n=================================\n\n\nSome changes have been made to the previously announced makeup the rest of the torrents - small changes are still possible. I plan on 11 more.  Approximate sizes listed based on what I have now. I still have duplicates and replacement scans to weed out and additions are possible. The big Batman one was popular so I'll do the same with Superman. The Superman torrent will be around 43-45gb, depending on how many replacement scans are in the folder now. I think it's a lot. I will not rush part 46, so as to give you all time to download.\n\nSizes given are the current size for the folder. Things may change.\n\nThe fill torrents continue to grow, as they will. It's possible there will be three. On the other hand there's a lot in there that may or may not be better scans than what I already shared. So there will be last minute shrinkage, which in this case, is far less embarrassing than another example I can think of.\n\nSizes given are the current size for the folder. Things may change.\n\n45 Superman                45gb\n46 Swe-Td                  14gb\n47 Te-Tn                   15gb\n48 To-Unk                  15gb\n49 Unl-Waq                 16gb\n50 War-Wn                  18gb\n51 Wonder*                 14gb\n52 World*                  13gb\n53 Wo-Z (-Wonder, World)   17gb\n54 Fill Torent A-D         20gb\n55 Fill Torent E-Z         19gb\n\n\n=================================\n\nYou know what's annoying but darn near inevitable? Shortly after every torrent I upload, new comics appear, or new scans of old comics, that should have been in it. Its as if the scanners were watching and waiting, just to drive me crazy. The hate me I know they hate me. Jealous of my rubber-chicken-like wit!\n\nThe latest, and I feel the most egregious, example is that the *day after* I uploaded the &quot;STAR&quot; torrent (#42) DC releases the first of a six part crossover with IDW! Time-Warner, owner of DC, is too lazy or disinterested to find out my ISP and send me a cease and desist. So they do this out of a petty desire for revenge. Yeah, I know these things are determined and announced far in advanced but they are clever and sneaky. They found a way. But the jokes on them - they ARE my ISP. So really they wouldn't have to look too far, (Unless I am making that up)\n\nOh and I also am well aware that if I read any comics news I'd be well aware of upcoming releases and could have waited a day or two for the new release to be scanned. But I am not dancing to DC's tune! They're not the boss of me. My wife is the boos of me!\n\nSo what is the IDW/DC crossover. What cool linkage of similar type comics have been &quot;leveraged to create synergy&quot; as they say in &quot;corporation speak&quot;?\n\nIt could have been &quot;G.I. Joe&quot; and &quot;Sgt. Rock&quot;!\n\nIt could have been &quot;30 Days of Night&quot; or &quot;True Blood&quot; with &quot;Supernatural&quot;! OR 30, True Blood AND Supernatural - Suggested title &quot;30 Truly Bloody Supernatural Nights&quot; &quot;American Vampire&quot; could make a cameo\n\nIt could have beeb &quot;Transformers&quot; and &quot;The Metal Men&quot;\n\nIt could have Been &quot;Doctor Who&quot; and &quot;Doctor Thirteen&quot;!\n\nIt could have been &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; and &quot;&quot;Hellblazer&quot;!\n\nBut these guys are more imaginative then me. What they did was, wild, ridiculous, highly implausible, and absolutely the coolest crossover ever done.\n\nThe Legion of Super Heroes meets freaking James Tiberius Kirk and crew. Brainiac 5 and Spock, together in one story!\nWhen and where do they meet? It's the 23rd century, on Earth - in what looks to be an even mores evil mirror universe than the Star Trek mirror universe we've seen before. I've only flipped through the first issue, but this evil Earth empire uses a symbol of two daggers through the earth, not just one. So they must be twice as bad. It stands to reason. I can only assume the Spock of this Universe has two beards, or at least a forked one. Uhura's uniform will be half as big as the mirror Uhura. Sulu will have two scars and Captain Kirk will have two &quot;Captains Women&quot; Twins, perhaps.\n\nEven more twists Legion planets like Durlan, home of Chameleon Boy, exist in this alternate universe.\n\nWell, on to the comics.\n\n=================================\n\nToday's offering:  DC from Superb-Swd  - Skipping titles beginning with Superman\n\nEnjoy!\n\nSuperboy\n     Millennium Edition 062-Superboy v1 001 44p\n     Superboy &amp; the Legion of Super-Heroes v1 231-258 (1977-1979)\n     Superboy (Aurora Promo)\n     Superboy 043 (UK(c1954)\n     Superboy Annual (UK(1958-9)\n     Superboy Plus 01-02 (1997)\n     Superboy Special 1992)\n     Superboy Spectacular 001\n     Superboy and the Legion of Super Heroes ctc B&amp;W (Tempo Books(1977)\n     Superboy and the Ravers 01-19 (1996-1998)\n     Superboy v1 001-230 (1949-1977)\n     Superboy v1 Annual 001 (Summer 1964)\n     Superboy v2 01-22 (1990-1992)\n     Superboy v3 000 (10-1994)\n     Superboy v3 001-100 (1994-2002)\n     Superboy v3 1,000,000 (1998)\n     Superboy v3 Annual 01-04 (1994-1997)\n     Superboy v4 01-11 (2011)\n     Superboy v5 01-xx (2011-20xx)\n     Superboy-Risk-Double-Shot (1998)\n     Superboy-Robin-World's Finest Three 01-02 (1996)\n\nSuperboy's Legion-Elseworlds 01-02 (2001)\n\nSupergirl\n     Supergirl Misc Extras\n     Supergirl Art, (Some fan), Movie Pics\n     Supergirl Cookies Trading Cards-Nabisco (1984\n     Supergirl Parody-MAD 253\n     Supergirl Title.gif\n     Supergirl v5 001-Parody\n\n     Supergirl Movie (1985)\n          Supergirl Movie Pics\n          Supergirl Movie Special 52p (1985)\n          Supergirl Movie Special Original Art 5p\n          Supergirl Storybook, The-Movie Adaptation Text and Photos\n          Supergirl The Movie Cards\n\n     Supergirl Plus 001-The Power of Shazam!
