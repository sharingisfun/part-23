Falk - &quot;Norman Einstein&quot;: The Dis-Integration of Ken Wilber (mobi, epub)\r\n\r\n\r\nKen Wilber is the &quot;long-sought Einstein of consciousness research,&quot; having been generously regarded as such since the late 1970s.\r\n\r\nKen Wilber is &quot;a genius of our times.&quot;\r\n\r\nKen Wilber is &quot;the world's most intriguing and foremost philosopher.&quot;\r\n\r\nKen Wilber's ideas have influenced Bill Clinton, Al Gore, Jeb Bush, Deepak Chopra, Tony Robbins, and a host of other luminaries, spiritual and otherwise. Writer Michael Crichton, leadership guru Warren Bennis, playwright Eve Ensler (*The Vagina Monologues*), alternative medicine's Larry Dossey, the Wachowski Brothers (directors of *The Matrix*), and a handful of rock stars have all lent their voices in support of the &quot;integral&quot; community.\r\n\r\nYet Ken Wilber, his celebrated theories of consciousness, and the increasingly unquestioning population of &quot;second-tier&quot; spiritual aspirants surrounding him and participating in his Integral Institute (I-I) and Integral University, are not what they appear to be.\r\n\r\n*&quot;Norman Einstein&quot;: The Dis-Integration of Ken Wilber* will show you why the community around Wilber is being increasingly called a &quot;cult,&quot; even by former founding members of I-I who have seen it first-hand.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeoffrey D. Falk is author of *Stripping the Gurus: Sex, Violence, Abuse and Enlightenment*, *Sam Harris and 'Spirituality Without Religion'*, and *Christianity and Islam: Two 'Religions of Peace' ... Not!* All are available for free, online.\r\n\r\nFree eBook reader, for all O/S: http://www.calibre-ebook.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:033811b700253f6ab2157e182b8c45516e47866d","amp;dn":"Norman+Einstein%3A+The+Dis-Integration+of+Ken+Wilber","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"033811b700253f6ab2157e182b8c45516e47866d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,56,17,183,0,37,63,106,178,21,126,24,43,140,69,81,110,71,134,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
