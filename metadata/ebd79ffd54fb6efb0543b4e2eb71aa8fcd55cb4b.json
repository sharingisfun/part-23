For over a decade, gamers have been guiding the cheerfully brainless beasts to safety in a variety of endlessly engaging puzzle settings. And now, if you fork over 5.99 to the PlayStation Store, you can download the newest version right to your PlayStation 3. Actually, its not really new--its quite similar to last years PlayStation Portable version. The solid gameplay of that version has survived intact, along with an online ranking system that lets you compare your score to others. Yet while the small screen of the PSP was a perfect fit for the compact levels, its limited scope is more noticeable now. And without the level editor and swapping of the other iteration, Sony and Team 17 let some of the wind out of the games sails.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ebd79ffd54fb6efb0543b4e2eb71aa8fcd55cb4b","amp;dn":"Lemmings.EUR.PS3-SUSHi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ebd79ffd54fb6efb0543b4e2eb71aa8fcd55cb4b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,215,159,253,84,251,110,251,5,67,180,226,235,113,170,143,205,85,203,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
