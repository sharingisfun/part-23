(with an Introduction by Neil Gaiman, a signature of full-color plates by JosÃƒÂ© Villarrubia, and a cover design by Chip Kidd).In a story full of lust, madness and ecstasy, we meet twelve distinctive characters that lived in the same region of central England over the span of six thousand years. Their narratives are woven together in patterns of recurring events, strange traditions and uncanny visions. First, a cave-boy loses his mother, falls in love and learns a deadly lesson. He is followed by an extraordinary cast of characters: a murderess who impersonates her victim, a Roman emissary who realizes the bitter truth about the Empire, a crippled nun who is healed miraculously by a disturbing apparition, two witches, lovers, who burn at the stake, and many more. Through each tale, Moore travels through history blending truth and conjecture, in a novel that is dazzling, moving, sometimes tragic, but always mesmerizing.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:68e4332faf0150c1364623b7a94a6be8ac94170d","amp;dn":"Voice+of+the+Fire","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"68e4332faf0150c1364623b7a94a6be8ac94170d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,228,51,47,175,1,80,193,54,70,35,183,169,74,107,232,172,148,23,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
