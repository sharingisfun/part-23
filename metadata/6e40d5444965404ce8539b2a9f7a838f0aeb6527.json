It is\npublished under the authority of a Joint Formulary\nCommittee which comprises representatives of the\ntwo professional bodies, the UK Health Departments,\nthe Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory\nAgency, and a national guideline producer. The Dental\nAdvisory Group oversees the preparation of advice on\nthe drug management of dental and oral conditions; the\nGroup includes representatives of the British Dental\nAssociation and a representative from the UK Health\nDepartments. The Nurse PrescribersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Advisory Group\nadvises on the content relevant to nurses and includes\nrepresentatives from different parts of the nursing community\nand from the UK Health Departments.\nThe BNF aims to provide prescribers, pharmacists, and\nother healthcare professionals with sound up-to-date\ninformation about the use of medicines.\nThe BNF includes key information on the selection,\nprescribing, dispensing and administration of medicines.\nMedicines generally prescribed in the UK are\ncovered and those considered less suitable for prescribing\nare clearly identified. Little or no information\nis included on medicines promoted for purchase by the\npublic.\nInformation on drugs is drawn from the manufacturersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢\nproduct literature, medical and pharmaceutical literature,\nUK health departments, regulatory authorities, and\nprofessional bodies. Advice is constructed from clinical\nliterature and reflects, as far as possible, an evaluation of\nthe evidence from diverse sources. The BNF also takes\naccount of authoritative national guidelines and emerging\nsafety concerns. In addition, the editorial team\nreceives advice on all therapeutic areas from expert\nclinicians; this ensures that the BNFÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s recommendations\nare relevant to practice.\nThe BNF is designed as a digest for rapid reference and\nit may not always include all the information necessary\nfor prescribing and dispensing. Also, less detail is given\non areas such as obstetrics, malignant disease, and\nanaesthesia since it is expected that those undertaking\ntreatment will have specialist knowledge and access to\nspecialist literature. BNF for Children should be consulted\nfor detailed information on the use of medicines\nin children. The BNF should be interpreted in the light of\nprofessional knowledge and supplemented as necessary\nby specialised publications and by reference to the\nproduct literature. Information is also available from\nmedicines information services (see inside front cover).\nIt is important to use the most recent BNF information\nfor making clinical decisions. The print edition of the\nBNF is updated in March and September each year.\nMonthly updates are provided online via the BNF Publications\nwebsite bnf.org, MedicinesComplete, and the\nNHS Evidence portal. The more important changes for\nthis edition are listed on p. xvii; changes listed online are\ncumulative (from one print edition to the next), and can\nbe printed off each month to show the main changes\nsince the last print edition as an aide memoire for those\nusing print copies.\nThe website (bnf.org) includes additional information of\nrelevance to healthcare professionals. Other digital formats\nof the BNFÃ¢â‚¬â€including versions for mobile devices\nand integration into local formulariesÃ¢â‚¬â€are also available.\n\n\n\nCopyright to the respective owners.If you like this book then please buy it.\nSharing is caring,Seed this torrent so others could enjoy it too.\nAny requests/suggestions can be made in the comments section or via email to &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;a1ccd4c9c0ccccc0c58fd6c0d0c0d38fc0c3c3c0d2e1cdc8d7c48fc2cecc&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nThanks","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e40d5444965404ce8539b2a9f7a838f0aeb6527","amp;dn":"Bnf-British+National+Formulary+67-Pharmaceutical+Press+%282014%29%5BUn","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e40d5444965404ce8539b2a9f7a838f0aeb6527","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,64,213,68,73,101,64,76,232,83,155,42,159,122,131,143,10,235,101,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
