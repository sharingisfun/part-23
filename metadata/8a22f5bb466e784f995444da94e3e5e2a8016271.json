His lonely son (NaschyÃ‚Â´s son, Sergio) now lives with Hector, AlexÃ‚Â´s nasty twin, an unsuccessful actor (Naschy), a servant, Eric (Howard Vernon), and a cook, Carmen (Caroline Munro). Hector dresses up as Rasputin, Fu Manchu, or Bluebeard and fools around with hookers, who are later found dead. The son watches his fatherÃ‚Â´s movies on TV, and various characters show up in real life. A friendly Frnakenstein monster, Mr. Hyde, the Wolf Man (Waldemar Daninsky??!!!), Quasimodo and the Phantom (all Naschy) appear. Meanwhile, Hector and a local priest lust after Carmen. This nutty Naschy-overkill movie has nudity, some gore, a zombie, and the Devil himself!\n\n According to IMDB and The Mark Of Naschy the total length of the movie is 97 minutes. My version was taken from the Spanish TV, and has a duration of 93 minutes aprox. I think that both are wrong, because this TV version has a lot of nudity and gore scenes. I canÃ‚Â´t confirm to 100 % this data.
