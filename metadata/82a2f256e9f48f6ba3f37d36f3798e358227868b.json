Born March 31, 1935, in Los Angeles, Alpert began playing the trumpet at the age of eight. After serving in the Army, he attempted to forge an acting career, but soon returned to music, recording under the name Dore Alpert for RCA. \n\n\nSergio Mendes - allmusic.com...\n\nFor most of the second half of the '60s, Sergio Mendes was the top-selling Brazilian artist in the United States, charting huge hit singles and LPs that regularly made the Top Five. His records with his group, Brasil '66, regularly straddled the domestic pop and international markets in America, getting played heavily on AM radio stations, both rock and easy listening, and he gave his label, A&amp;M, something to offer light jazz listeners beyond the work of the company's co-founder, Herb Alpert. During this period, he also became an international music star and one of the most popular musicians in South America. \n\n\nGenre................: Latin Jazz\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nLabel.................: A&amp;M Records\nIncluded.............: Covers, auCDtect, Log, Cue\n\n\nHerb Alpert - The Very Best Of Herb Alpert (1991)\n\n01.The Lonely Bull (El Solo Toro)\n02.A Taste Of Honey\n03.Tijuana Taxi\n04.Spanish Flea\n05.Zorba The Greek\n06.What Now My Love\n07.Casino Royale\n08.This Guy's In Love With You\n09.Without Her\n10.Jerusalem\n11.Rise\n12.Rotation\n13.Keep Your Eye On Me\n14.Diamonds\n15.Jump Street\n\n\nSergio Mendes &amp; Brasil '66 - The Very Best (1986)\n\n01.Mais Que Nada\n02.Scarborough Fair\n03.With A Little Help From My Friends\n04.Like A Lover\n05.Look Of Love\n06.Night And Day\n07.Fool On The Hill\n08.Norwegian Wood\n09.Going Out Of My Head\n10.Look Around\n11.So Many Stars\n12.Daytripper\n13.Pretty World\n14.Wave\n15.Pais Tropical\n16.Watch What Happens\n\n\n\n\n\nTHANKS for Seeding!\nCheers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:82a2f256e9f48f6ba3f37d36f3798e358227868b","amp;dn":"Herb+Alpert+%2B+Sergio+Mendes+%26amp%3B+Brasil+%2766+Very+Best+Of+%7BFLAC%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"82a2f256e9f48f6ba3f37d36f3798e358227868b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,162,242,86,233,244,143,107,163,243,125,54,243,121,142,53,130,39,134,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
