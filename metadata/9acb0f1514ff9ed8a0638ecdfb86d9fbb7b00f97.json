The HTML5 module enables you to produce ready-to-run HTML and JavaScript code that you can host or embed on any website, the Android module enables you to create and distribute *.apk files and if you have iOS developer account you can also publish to iPad, iPhone and iPod with the iOS module. These modules are available only to those who have upgraded from the Free or Standard version of GameMaker:Studio to the Professional version (more information on the different versions can be found here). \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9acb0f1514ff9ed8a0638ecdfb86d9fbb7b00f97","amp;dn":"Game+Maker+Studio","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9acb0f1514ff9ed8a0638ecdfb86d9fbb7b00f97","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,203,15,21,20,255,158,216,160,99,142,205,251,134,217,251,183,176,15,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
