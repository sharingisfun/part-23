(Message in a Bottle) [promo].VOB\n\n\nHQ rare promo music video from a promo DVD. &quot;Message in a Bottle&quot; is a 1979 song by English rock band The Police, from their second album, Reggatta de Blanc.\n\nRolling Stone ranked it number 65 on their list of the &quot;100 Greatest Guitar Songs of All Time&quot;.\n\nSander van Doorn released the song under his alias Filterfunk in 2005 as &quot;S.O.S. (Message in a Bottle)&quot;. Sander van Doorn is a Dutch electronic dance music producer and DJ. He is listed at DJMag's top 100 djs list, debuting at #32 in 2006, then moving up to #13 in 2008, being #10 in 2009, down to #12 in 2010, and as of 2012, is listed as #18 DJ in the world.\n\nThe song is ostensibly about a story of a castaway on an island, who sends out a message in a bottle to seek love. A year later, he has not received any sort of response, and despairs, thinking he is destined to be alone. The next day, he sees &quot;a hundred billion bottles&quot; on the shore, finding out that there are more people like him out there.\n\nThe single was The Police's first number one hit in the UK Singles Chart,[2] but only reached number 74 in the United States. An alternate &quot;Classic Rock&quot; mix is available on Every Breath You Take: The Classics. This is Sting's favourite song as confessed to Jools Holland of BBC fame.\n(video does not have any logos)\n\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_in_a_Bottle_(song)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_in_a_Bottle_(song)&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/PaoEHAAFn&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/PaoEHAAFn&lt;/a&gt; \n   \n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:     \n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x576 (16:9) 50fps 8000kbps\n   Audio: Dolby Digital AC3 48000Hz stereo 448kbps\n   Duration: 00:02:49\n\n*Size info:\n   DVD PAL 16/9 aspect ratio widescreen playback rez of 1024 Ãƒâ€” 576 which is the default resolution used for PAL 16/9 HD video.\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
