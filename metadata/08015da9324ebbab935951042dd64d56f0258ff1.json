Secretary Delacourt, a government official, will stop at nothing to enforce anti-immigration laws and preserve the luxurious lifestyle of the citizens of Elysium. That doesn't stop the people of Earth from trying to get in by any means they can. When unlucky Max is backed into a corner, he agrees to take on a daunting mission that, if successful, will not only save his life but could bring equality to these polarized worlds.\n\n\nMenu: Untouched\nVideo: 2 909 Kbps\nExtras: Untouched\nAspect Ratio: 16x9\nRuntime: 110mins\nLanguages: Eng, Por, Spa, Thai\nSubtitles: Eng, Dut, Chi, Kor, Malay, Por, Spa, Thai","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:08015da9324ebbab935951042dd64d56f0258ff1","amp;dn":"Elysium.NTSC.2013","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"08015da9324ebbab935951042dd64d56f0258ff1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,1,93,169,50,78,187,171,147,89,81,4,45,214,77,86,240,37,143,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
