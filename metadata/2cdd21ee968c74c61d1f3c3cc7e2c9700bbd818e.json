When an accident leaves Alicia comatose she is admitted in the hospital where Benigno works and the girl of his dreams falls under his care. Marco is a journalist whose lover Lydia, a female bull-fighter, has also fallen in a coma. The two men meet and get to be friends despite their contrasting characters; Marco is steadfast yet sensitive and Benigno's apparently soft character hides a darker side. In my opinion this is Almodovar's best film to date.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2cdd21ee968c74c61d1f3c3cc7e2c9700bbd818e","amp;dn":"Hable+Con+Ella+%28Talk+To+Her%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2cdd21ee968c74c61d1f3c3cc7e2c9700bbd818e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,221,33,238,150,140,116,198,29,31,60,60,199,226,201,112,11,189,129,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
