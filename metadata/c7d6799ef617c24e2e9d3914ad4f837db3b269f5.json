The film stars Bob Denver as Dusty, the bumbling assistant to Wagonmaster Callahan featured in the syndicated series Dusty's Trail.\n\nThe film itself consists of four episodes of Dusty's Trail edited together.\n\nA stagecoach and covered wagon heading west across the plains become separated from their wagon train thanks to Dusty (Denver), a bumbling assistant to Wagonmaster Callahan (Forrest Tucker). Lost in the wilderness, seven hapless souls must now make their way to California on their own using what brains they have or haven't got.\n\nFirst, the characters meet &quot;Injuns&quot; who are not unlike the Hekawis in F Troop. Then there is a &quot;necktie party&quot; looking to hang Dusty as a horse thief. Third, a couple of cattle rustlers want to &quot;get friendly&quot; with some willing females. And finally, a &quot;shootout&quot; takes place, with Dusty dressed up as Bat Masterson in a ghost town setting.\n\n\nFour episodes of Dusty's Trail edited together into a movie. The episodes, in the order shown, are: &quot;Tomahawk Territory&quot;, &quot;Horse of Another Color&quot;, &quot;There is Nothing Like a Dame&quot;, and &quot;The Not So Magnificent Seven&quot;.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0295018/?ref_=fn_tt_tt_1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0295018/?ref_=fn_tt_tt_1&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wackiest_Wagon_Train_in_the_West&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wackiest_Wagon_Train_in_the_West&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c7d6799ef617c24e2e9d3914ad4f837db3b269f5","amp;dn":"The+Wackiest+Wagon+Train+In+The+West+%7B1976+Bob+Denver%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c7d6799ef617c24e2e9d3914ad4f837db3b269f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,214,121,158,246,23,194,78,46,157,57,20,173,79,131,125,179,178,105,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
