They have been building a loyal following since 2004 with two Eulogy releases (2007's &quot;Moment of Truth&quot; and 2009's &quot;Embrace&quot;) along with their hard hitting live show. Touring with bands such as Every Time I Die, Emmure and Terror in more than 5 continents and 17 countries, Thick As Blood is a force to be reckoned with. The bands latest album &quot;Living Proof&quot; was produced by Nick Jett (Terror) and released July 10th.\nDescription\nMoment Of Truth - 2007\nEmbrace - 2009\nLiving Proof 2012\nBasic Info\nJoined Facebook\t11/11/2009\nGenre\tHardcore/Metal\nMembers\tGino Vento - vocals\nRandy Gonzalez - guitar\nHeavy Jerry- guitar\nJames Siboni - bass\nHometown\tMiami, FL\nRecord Label\tRise Records\nCurrent Location\tMiami, FL\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:661e10fecbdefc1a48a55bfefc5d5b79b1211e8b","amp;dn":"Thick+As+Blood+-+Living+Proof++MP3++320k+++ak6103","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"661e10fecbdefc1a48a55bfefc5d5b79b1211e8b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,30,16,254,203,222,252,26,72,165,91,254,252,93,91,121,177,33,30,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
