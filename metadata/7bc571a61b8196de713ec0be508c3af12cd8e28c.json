Gang of Four\nIn the first episode, Waldemar delves into the back stories of four of the most influential Impressionists - Pissarro, Monet, Renoir and Bazille - who together laid the foundations of the artistic movement. He finds out what social and cultural influences drove them to their style of painting, how they were united and how ultimately they challenged and changed art forever. Waldemar journeys from the shores of the West Indies, to the progressive city of Paris to the suburbs of South London, where these four artists drew inspiration from the cities and towns in which they lived. He discovers how the Impressionists broke conventions by depicting every day encounters within the unpredictable and ever changing sights around them.\n\nBBC Site: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b012rvkl&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b012rvkl&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTechnical Spec\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC\nVideo Bitrate: 4000 Kbps\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.777:1\nVideo Resolution: 1280x720\nAudio Codec: AAC\nAudio Bitrate: 128 Kbps ABR 48KHz\nAudio Channels: 2\nRun-Time: 59 mins\nFramerate: 25 FPS\nNumber of Parts: 4\nPart Size: 1.72 MB\nSubtitles: merged\nSource: HDTV\n\nSRT and Xvid available at MVGroup","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7bc571a61b8196de713ec0be508c3af12cd8e28c","amp;dn":"BBC+The+Impressionists+1of4+Gang+of+Four+HDTV+x264+AAC+MVGroup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7bc571a61b8196de713ec0be508c3af12cd8e28c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,197,113,166,27,129,150,222,113,62,192,190,80,140,58,241,44,216,226,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
