Look Sharp! was re-released in 2001 with two bonus tracks, &quot;Don't Ask Me&quot; and &quot;You Got the Fever&quot; the respective b-sides of the singles &quot;One More Time&quot; and &quot;Is She Really Going Out with Him?&quot; originally released in May and July 1979. In addition to the standard 12-inch vinyl release, the record was also released in a special package on two 10-inch discs that also included a Look Sharp! badge. The cover is number 22 on Rolling Stone's list of the 100 greatest album covers of all time. \n\nJoe Jackson (born David Ian Jackson, 11 August 1954) is an English musician and singer-songwriter now living in Berlin, whose five Grammy Award nominations span from 1979 to 2001. He is probably best known for the 1979 hit song and first single &quot;Is She Really Going Out with Him?&quot;, which still gets extensive US FM radio airplay; for his 1982 hit, &quot;Steppin' Out&quot;; and for his 1984 success with &quot;You Can't Get What You Want (Till You Know What You Want)&quot;. He was popular for his pop/rock and New Wave music early on before moving to more eclectic, though less commercially successful, pop/jazz/classical hybrids. \n\nHe has been quoted as saying he now spends most of his time in Berlin, but still has places in Portsmouth and New York City. Jackson noted his enthusiasm for real ale in his autobiography, A Cure For Gravity, published in 1999, which Jackson has described as a &quot;book about music, thinly disguised as a memoir&quot;. It traces his working class upbringing in Portsmouth and charts his musical life from childhood until his twenty-fourth birthday. Life as a pop star, he insisted, was hardly worth writing about.\n(video does not have any logos)\n\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Look_Sharp!_(Joe_Jackson_album)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Look_Sharp!_(Joe_Jackson_album)&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Old_Grey_Whistle_Test&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Old_Grey_Whistle_Test&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/EAJlfAAeN&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/EAJlfAAeN&lt;/a&gt; \n   \n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic: \n   Video : MPEG2 Video 720x576 (4:3) 25fps 9200kbps\n   Audio1: Dolby Digital AC3 48000Hz stereo 192kbps\n   Audio2: Dolby Digital AC3 48000Hz stereo 192kbps (commentary)\n   Duration: 00:04:29\n\n\n*To change the audio in &quot;Media Player Classic&quot;, just go to &quot;Navigate&quot; then &quot;Audio Language&quot; and choose between the 2 sources*\n\n*To shut off the Subtitles in &quot;Media Player Classic&quot;, just go to &quot;Navigate&quot; then &quot;Subtitle Language&quot; and choose &quot;No Subtitle&quot;\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
