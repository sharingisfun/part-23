After the sudden disappearance of his beloved dog Sparky, little Victor uses the power of science to bring his best friend back to life, albeit with a few minor adjustments. Victor tries to hide his creation 'home', but when Sparky manages to get out, the Victor's classmates, teachers and the entire city will realize that creating a new life can become a monstrous experiment.\n\nProduction notes:\n- Based on the eponymous short film Burton shot himself in 1984.\n- Animated frame by frame technique (stop-motion), Frankenweenie will be filmed in black and white and then be rendered in 3D, which will elevate the classic style of animation to a whole new experience.\n================================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a6438bf959697d0e75d031c2e3b0fe3802462a3","amp;dn":"Frankenweenie+%282012%29+%5BMicroHD+1080p%5D%5BDUAL%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a6438bf959697d0e75d031c2e3b0fe3802462a3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,100,56,191,149,150,151,208,231,93,3,28,46,59,15,227,128,36,98,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
