Guitar Hero is played with a guitar-shaped controller that features five fret buttons, a strum sensor, and a working whammy bar. Gamers can jam along with more than 30 classic and contemporary songs, including numbers by the Ramones, Ozzy Osbourne, White Zombie, and Franz Ferdinand. Success involves both synchronization and style. The game's story mode progresses through six different venues, from the makeshift basement studio to the sold-old stadium concert\n\n...................................\n\nWhere all leachers in the end~But for once-How about seeding so others can get this as well..\nWith that please seed at least 150% of the files givin..\n\nThank you for downloading\n\nLater,\nCivic/Scootin","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a56d645c8809e86fc528a27f7dfc224ab6f7c64","amp;dn":"Guitar+Hero+I+%28NTSC%2FUSA.ESR-Pre+Patched.PS2%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a56d645c8809e86fc528a27f7dfc224ab6f7c64","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,86,214,69,200,128,158,134,252,82,138,39,247,223,194,36,171,111,124,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
