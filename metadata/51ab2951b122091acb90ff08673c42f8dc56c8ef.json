Yet, unfortunately, it happens to be peculiarly timely that this study gets attention and goes online just now. That's because we're mired again in wars - especially in Afghanistan - remarkably similar to the 30-year conflict in Vietnam, and we don't have comparable documentation and insider analysis to enlighten us on how we got here and where it's likely to go.\n\nWhat we need released this month are the Pentagon Papers of Iraq and Afghanistan (and Pakistan, Yemen and Libya). We're not likely to get them; they probably don't yet exist, at least in the useful form of the earlier ones. But the original studies on Vietnam are a surprisingly not-bad substitute, definitely worth learning from.\n. . .\nTo motivate voters and Congress to extricate us from these presidential wars, we need the Pentagon Papers of the Middle East wars right now. Not 40 years in the future. Not after even two or three more years of further commitment to stalemated and unjustifiable wars.\n. . .\nVery, very few of those who do have [access to top secret, high-level recommendations, estimates and decisions] are willing to risk their clearances and careers - and the growing possibility (under President Obama) of prosecution - by documenting to Congress and the public even[,] policies that they personally believe are disastrous and wrongly kept secret and lied about. ...\n\nI've long regretted that it didn't even occur to me, in August 1964, to release the documents in my Pentagon safe giving the lie to claims of an &quot;unequivocal, unprovoked&quot; (unreal) attack on our destroyers in the Tonkin Gulf: precursors of the &quot;evidence beyond any doubt&quot; of nonexistent WMDs in Iraq, which manipulated Congress, once again, to pass the exact counterpart of the Tonkin Gulf resolution.\n\nSenator Morse - one of the two senators who had voted against that unconstitutional, undated blank cheque for presidential war in 1964 - told me that if I had provided him with that evidence at the time (instead of 1969, when I finally provided it to the senate foreign relations committee, on which he had served): &quot;The Tonkin Gulf resolution would never have gotten out of committee; and if it had been brought to the floor, it would have been voted down.&quot;\n\nThat's a heavy burden for me to bear: especially when I reflect that, by September, I had a drawer-full of the top secret documents (again, regrettably, not published until 1971) proving the fraudulence of Johnson's promises of &quot;no wider war&quot; in his election campaign, and his actual determination to escalate a war that he privately and realistically regarded as unwinnable.\n\nHad I or one of the scores of other officials who had the same high-level information acted then on our oath of office - which was not an oath to obey the president, nor to keep the secret that he was violating his own sworn obligations, but solely an oath &quot;to support and defend the constitution of the United States&quot; - that terrible war might well have been averted altogether. But to hope to have that effect, we would have needed to disclose the documents when they were current, before the escalation - not five or seven, or even two, years after the fateful commitments had been made.\n\nA lesson to be drawn from reading the Pentagon Papers, knowing all that followed or has come out in the years since, is this. To those in the Pentagon, state department, the White House, CIA (and their counterparts in Britain and other [NATO] countries) who have similar access to mine then and foreknowledge of disastrous escalations in our wars in the Middle East, I would say:\n\nDon't make my mistake. Don't do what I did. Don't wait until a new war has started in Iran, until more bombs have fallen in Afghanistan, in Pakistan, Libya, Iraq or Yemen. Don't wait until thousands more have died, before you go to the press and to Congress to tell the truth with documents that reveal lies or crimes or internal projections of costs and dangers. Don't wait 40 years for it to be declassified, or seven years as I did for you or someone else to leak it.\n\nThe personal risks are great. But a war's worth of lives might be saved.\n\n=====================================================================\n\nEach Pentagon Papers file is a .pdf file.
