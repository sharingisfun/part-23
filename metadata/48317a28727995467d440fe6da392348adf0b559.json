World War 3 is upon us, This fact can not be denied by anyone with a Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¼ of a Brain. When War breaks out everything else breaks down. No Electricity will bring America and all Major Powers to their KNEES. (EMP) Third World Countries will be least affected as their dependence on electricity is much less. NO Electricity means NO fuel, pumps are electric. No electricity means no infrastructure, NO WATER, NO FOOD, NO MEDICINE, NO CARS, NO POLICE, NO FIRE DEPARTMENT, NO AMBULANCES, NO HOSPITALS, NO SCHOOLS, NO WORK, NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO Things No NOTHING!!!\n\nKatrina showed us that in 3 days with no Food or Water people start killing each other.

The LAW wonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t have gas after awhile either and Marshal Law will Break Down. You will be on your own. Are you ready for any of the tribulation that is coming our way? Me neither. The RAPTURE will take some of us away from all that. Are you one of them that does not have to worry about all that? I am. I am putting this out for all those that are left behind when the Rapture occurs and DOES NOT WANT TO TAKE THE MARK OF THE BEAST AND WANTS TO SURVIVE THE TRIBULATION and live with Jesus in Eternity.\n\n&quot;Believe it or not, I was so impressed with this series of videos that it was one of the reasons I started CampingSurvival.com. Being a former Marine and outdoors enthusiast, I greatly appreciate the excellent job Ron and Karen Hood do of sharing their vast knowledge of camping and survival skills. However, despite all that they teach in every video, I still find them to be very entertaining as well. These videos are so enjoyable that they make me long for Spring even before winter has started!

He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.\n\nRAPtURE (My transportation outta here).\n\nThe Blessed Hope.  If you believe in The Rapture you better believe The Above Statement and that the Sacrificed Blood of Jesus, on the Cross paid for your sins and there is NOTHING Else you can do to gain Salvation, The GRACE of Christ did it ALL. Now you just have to believe that with all your Heart, Mind and Soul or Maybe Get Left Behind. All PAST, Present and Future Sins are Forgiven with Jesus. (I wouldn't PUSH That Future sin statement to much!!!)\n\nIn a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed...\n\n&quot;And He will send forth His angels with A GREAT TRUMPET and THEY WILL GATHER TOGETHER His elect from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.\n\n&quot;Do not marvel at this; for an hour is coming, in which all who are in the tombs will hear His voice,  Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in The Air, and there we will be forever be with him...hmmm sounds like some of us might be Immortal. (Ask your preacher about that)\n\nMore Torrents in this series atALL TORRENTS are RELEASED here FIRST!!! The First down loaders of my torrents get the Main Hookups on my SERVER.
