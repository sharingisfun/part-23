Readers of Conn Iggulden, Simon Scarrow and Bernard Cornwell will be delighted to discover a new series to follow.\n\nEngland, 1346: For Thomas Blackstone the choice is easy - dance on the end of a rope for a murder he did not commit, or take up his war bow and join the king's invasion of France.\n\nAs he fights his way across northern France, Blackstone will learn the brutal lessons of war - from the terror and confusion of his first taste of combat, to the savage realities of siege warfare.\n\nVastly outnumbered, Edward III's army will finally confront the armoured might of the French nobility on the field of Cr?cy. It is a battle that will change the history of warfare, a battle that will change the course of Blackstone's life, a battle that is just the first chapter in a book of legend - Blackstone: Master of War.\n\nAuthor:\n\nDavid Gilman had a varied career including firefighter, soldier and marketing manager, before turning to writing full time. He is an award-winning British author and screenwriter.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d693d5aad45e7fb2fe1541b4d33c6ea7d1a1020e","amp;dn":"Master+Of+War%3A+The+Blooding+%282013%29+David+Gilman","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d693d5aad45e7fb2fe1541b4d33c6ea7d1a1020e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,147,213,170,212,94,127,178,254,21,65,180,211,60,110,167,209,161,2,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
