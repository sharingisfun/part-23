In &quot;HISTORY'S RAIDERS&quot; some of the most exciting and decisive small unit actions have been minutely researched and uncovered with unprecedented access to over 500,000 hours of archive film, much of which will be seen in the series for the first time. \n\nProduced by Nugus / Martin Productions Ltd for the History Channel MMI\n\n\n\nEpisode 19 : US Rangers and the Raid on Cabanatuan\n\nImpressed by the performance of Britain's new elite force, the Commandos, the US Army set up its own special unit - the Rangers. These took part in many of the major Allied landings in Europe, capturing vital strongpoints. In the Pacific, one of their most spectacular actions was a raid deep behind enemy lines to free prisoners-of-war, threatened with massacre by the Japanese.\n\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 2267 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 704x528\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 29.970\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 256kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: english\nRunTime Per Part: 44:46.411\nNumber Of Parts: 26\nPart Size: 815 MB\nRipped by: DocFreak08\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db5dc4f099053e7bcbdb060db9e773fbf037007b","amp;dn":"HC.History%27s.Raiders.19of26.US.Rangers.and.the.Raid.on.Cabanatua","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db5dc4f099053e7bcbdb060db9e773fbf037007b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,93,196,240,153,5,62,123,203,219,6,13,185,231,115,251,240,55,0,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
