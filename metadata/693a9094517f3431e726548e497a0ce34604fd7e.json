The aspirant writer Bobby Davis feels pressed by his wife and hates his job. The shy geek computer analyst Dudley Frank is unsuccessful with women. The wealthy Woody Stevens is married with a top-model. Together, the four middle-aged friends in their motorcycles self-call the &quot;Wild Hogs&quot;. When Woody loses his wife and is completely broken, he invites his friends to take a road trip to the Pacific, in a quest for freedom. After many incidents, they stop for a beer in a bar owned by the dangerous biker gang &quot;Del Fuegos&quot;. Their tough leader Jack steals Dudleys motorcycle, and Woody decides to recover the bike back. Woody cuts the fuel pipes of the bikes and provokes an accident, exploding their bar, but he does not tell the truth to his friends. When they stop in the small town of Madrid without gas, Dudley falls in love for the waitress and owner of the local bar Maggie. However, the &quot;Del Fuegos&quot; traps them in the town and the &quot;Wild Hogs&quot; have to take an attitude.\n\n---------------\n| Ripper note |\n---------------\nRipped and Uploaded by: sal10851==---Show your support by seeding!!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:693a9094517f3431e726548e497a0ce34604fd7e","amp;dn":"WildHogs%5B2007%5DDvdRip%5BEng%5D-sal10851","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"693a9094517f3431e726548e497a0ce34604fd7e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,58,144,148,81,127,52,49,231,38,84,142,73,122,12,227,70,4,253,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
