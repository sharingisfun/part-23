In short, it lies like a rug. The creator of this maddening mess, Terry Beatty, is obviously a demented madman, unable to discern fantasy from reality. I wouldn't listen to a thing he has to say.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:77c19fb670dd4b13b977678ba2b9636dd9adf0b6","amp;dn":"The+Phony+Pages+%28Restored%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"77c19fb670dd4b13b977678ba2b9636dd9adf0b6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,193,159,182,112,221,75,19,185,119,103,139,162,185,99,109,217,173,240,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
