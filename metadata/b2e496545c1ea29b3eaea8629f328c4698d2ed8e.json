While Elinor is thoughtful, considerate, and calm, her younger sister is emotional and wildly romantic. Both are looking for a husband, but neither ElinorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s reason nor MarianneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s passion can lead them to perfect happinessÃ¢â‚¬â€as Marianne falls for an unscrupulous rascal and Elinor becomes attached to a man whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s already engaged. \n\nStartling secrets, unexpected twists, and heartless betrayals interrupt the marriage games that follow. Filled with satiric wit and subtle characterizations, Sense and Sensibility teaches that true love requires a balance of reason and emotion. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense_and_Sensibility&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense_and_Sensibility&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSense and Sensibility is a novel by Jane Austen, and was her first published work when it appeared in 1811 under the pseudonym &quot;A Lady&quot;. A work of romantic fiction, Sense and Sensibility is set in southwest England between 1792 and 1797, and portrays the life and loves of the Dashwood sisters, Elinor and Marianne. The novel follows the young ladies to their new home, a meager cottage on a distant relative's property, where they experience love, romance and heartbreak. The philosophical resolution of the novel is ambiguous: the reader must decide whether sense and sensibility have truly merged.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b2e496545c1ea29b3eaea8629f328c4698d2ed8e","amp;dn":"Jane+Austen+-+Sense+and+Sensibility+%5B96%5D+%282008+Reading+by+Wanda+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b2e496545c1ea29b3eaea8629f328c4698d2ed8e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,228,150,84,92,30,162,155,62,174,168,98,159,50,140,70,152,210,237,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
