Now the indomitable duo of Arthur Bryant and John May, along with the rest of their quirky team, return to solve a confounding case with dark ties to the British theater and a killer who may mean curtains for all involved.\n\nFor the crew of the New Strand Theatre, the play The Two Murderers seems less performance than prophecy when a cast party ends in the shocking death of the theater ownerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s son. The crime scene is most unusual, even for Bryant and May. In a locked bedroom without any trace of fingerprints or blood, the only sign of disturbance is a gruesome life-size puppet of Mr. Punch laying on the floor.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e33ce1eb42252ef50c75940b147bf0118e7e01ed","amp;dn":"Christopher+Fowler-The+Memory+of+Blood","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e33ce1eb42252ef50c75940b147bf0118e7e01ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,60,225,235,66,37,46,245,12,117,148,11,20,123,240,17,142,126,1,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
