Perhaps a little unfairly\nlumped in with easy listening - you can\nusually find old albums sitting side by\nside with dodgy organ records and\ncovers albums in charity shops - it was\nsomething of a boom industry in the\n1950s. This excellent collection of\nrare, obscure and little known 1950s\nexotica from the Captain High label\ntells the story of the genre's\ngestation and boom, showcasing its'\nlinks with jazz, traditional Hawaiian\nand Polynesian styles and, of course,\neasy listening. It's a rather wonderful\ncollection, all told, where tribal\ndrums and lilting pedal steel sit side\nby side with monkey noises, parrot\nsquawks, odd spoken word interludes and\nlashings of original vinyl crackle.\n\npsst, more info at captain-high-records.com\n\n01     Aloha Malahini - Intro                               01:56\n02     The Gene Rains Group - Bangkok Cock Fight            02:28\n03     Ted Auletta &amp; His Orchestra - Quiet Village          03:27\n04     Jerry Byrd - Bird Of Paradise                        03:01\n05     The Surfmen - Taboo                                  03:51\n06     Frank Hunter &amp; His Orchestra - White Goddess         02:52\n07     Warren Baker &amp; His Orchestra - Malayan Nightbird     02:17\n08     Phil Moore &amp; His Orchestra - Return To Paradise      02:33\n09     Johnny Spencer &amp; The Kona Koasters - S Pacifica      02:22\n10     The Royal Samoans - Simalu                           03:29\n11     Milt Raskin - Kapu                                   03:39\n12     The Polynesians - Hawaiian China Doll                03:12\n13     Chaino &amp; His African Percussion Safari - The Jungle  02:56\n       Chase\n14     Sondi Sonsai - Sondi                                 02:48\n15     The Yokohama Knights - A Man &amp; A Woman               02:42\n16     Outrigger Canoe Ride - Outro                         01:33","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:48c621537c4dd7c15f0353dfc83a7d79fbb3f8b8","amp;dn":"VA-Paradise_Found-Rare_Exotic_Sounds_Vol.1-%28CH4804-2%29-Reissue-CD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"48c621537c4dd7c15f0353dfc83a7d79fbb3f8b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,198,33,83,124,77,215,193,95,3,83,223,200,58,125,121,251,179,248,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
