As well as recounting \nthe events of Coronation Day, 2nd June 1953, the film focuses on the months of meticulous \nplanning beforehand. What took place behind the scenes is told using diaries, letters, official \nrecords and government papers, together with much rare, evocative archive. There are interviews \nwith historians and experts on royal ceremonial as well as participants in the ceremony. \nThe Coronation was an immense challenge - the views of forceful personalities from die-hard \ntraditionalists to forward-thinking innovators had to be reconciled, the movements of thousands \nhad to be marshalled like clockwork, and the BBC had to mount its most ambitious television \noutside broadcast to date in the teeth of prime minister Winston Churchill's opposition. At the \ncentre of it all was the 27-year-old Queen, bearing an immense responsibility while remaining \napparently calm and unperturbed throughout.\n\nThis is a story of precision planning, last minute nerves and an ancient ceremony which brought \ntogether church, state, aristocracy and monarchy in a glorious panoply - the like of which will \nnever be seen again.\n\n\n\n1h 28mn| 1.21 GiB | 720x400 | 1953 Kbps | 25.000 fps | AAC | 256 Kbps Vbr | 2 ch | QF 0.236\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://torrent-stats.info/aa74/13aba654c.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://torrent-stats.info/aa74/13aba654c.png&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0bc23d03e37199d91e31aa74f2a215f3ced8f3a2","amp;dn":"BBC+-+Coronation+of+Queen+Elizabeth+II+%5BMP4-AAC%5D%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0bc23d03e37199d91e31aa74f2a215f3ced8f3a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,194,61,3,227,113,153,217,30,49,170,116,242,162,21,243,206,216,243,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
