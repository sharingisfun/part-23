Sam Halpern, who is Ã¢â‚¬Å“like Socrates, but angrier, and with worse hair,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ has never minced words, and when Justin moved back home, he began to record all the ridiculous things his dad said to him:\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“That woman was sexy...Out of your league? Son, let women figure out why they wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t screw you. DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t do it for them.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Do people your age know how to comb their hair? It looks like two squirrels crawled on their heads and started fucking.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“The worst thing you can be is a liar...Okay, fine, yes, the worst thing you can be is a Nazi, but then number two is liar. Nazi one, liar two.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nMore than a million people now follow Mr. HalpernÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s philosophical musings on Twitter, and in this book, his son weaves a brilliantly funny, touching coming-of-age memoir around the best of his quotes.\n\nAn all-American story that unfolds on the Little League field, in DennyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s, during excruciating family road trips, and, most frequently, in the HalpernsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ kitchen over bowls of Grape-Nuts, Sh-t My Dad Says is a chaotic, hilarious, true portrait of a father-son relationship from a major new comic voice.\n\nJust listen and laugh.
