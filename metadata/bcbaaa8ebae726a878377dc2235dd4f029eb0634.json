Several of them were recorded and interviewed by folklorist Dr. Harry Oster between 1952 and 1960, and some of this material was originally issued on his Folklyric label. These are raw, powerful, largely improvised personal blues stories, as well as traditional songs. This CD features many previously unreleased items including the haunting monologue from Roosevelt Charles which ends the record, as well as unreleased tracks by women singers Odea Mathews, Clara Young and Thelma Mae Joseph. \nAll previously unreleased, except 1 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n1.
