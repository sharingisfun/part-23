She was wrong. Working for her mom's new house-cleaning business puts Rachel in the dirty bathrooms of the most popular kids in the eighth grade. Which does not help her already loser-ish reputation. But her new job has surprising perks: enough dirt on the in-crowd to fill up her (until recently) boring diary. She never intended to reveal her secrets, but when the hottest guy in school pays her to spy on his girlfriend Rachel decides to get her hands dirty.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e19ff59284bcb07e8828316ebe5608df4d9bb60","amp;dn":"The+Dirt+Diary+-+Anna+Staniszewski+%5BEPUB%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e19ff59284bcb07e8828316ebe5608df4d9bb60","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,25,255,89,40,75,203,7,232,130,131,22,235,229,96,141,244,217,187,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
