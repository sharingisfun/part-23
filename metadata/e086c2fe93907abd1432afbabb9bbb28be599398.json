The band signed with Capitol Records in 1990, and released their first single on that same year on 7-inch vinyl. Their self-titled debut was released in March 1991, followed by their first single, &quot;Three Strange Days.&quot; Also during the same year, they appeared on a KROQ concert disc called the Acoustic Christmas. Their second album, Human Cannonball, was released in 1993. The album did not sell very well and was not as successful as the self-titled album. Shortly thereafter, the band broke up.\n\n\nTrack listing\n\n   1. &quot;Intro&quot;\n   2. &quot;3 Strange Days&quot;\n   3. &quot;Talk Like Strangers&quot;\n   4. &quot;Deep End&quot;\n   5. &quot;King Of The Dollar&quot;\n   6. &quot;Speechless&quot;\n   7. &quot;Wrong&quot;\n   8. &quot;Rose Colored Glasses&quot;\n   9. &quot;Under The Microscope&quot;\n  10. &quot;Fell&quot;\n  11. &quot;Euphoria&quot;\n\nI'll be uploading their second and final album, Human Cannonball shortly.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e086c2fe93907abd1432afbabb9bbb28be599398","amp;dn":"School+of+Fish+-+School+of+Fish","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e086c2fe93907abd1432afbabb9bbb28be599398","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,134,194,254,147,144,122,189,20,50,175,186,187,155,187,40,190,89,147,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
