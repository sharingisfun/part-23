H. AUDEN (1907-1973) was an Anglo-American poet and essayist, regarded by many critics as one of the greatest writers of the 20th century.\n\nHis SELECTED POEMS (1979) includes 100 poems, including some that he rejected and early texts of poems that he revised.\n\nIn THE DYER'S HAND (1962), Auden assembled, edited, and arranged a selection of essays, reviews, and collections of aphorisms and notes written from the early 1950s through 1962.  Many items were not previously published; others appeared in revised form.  Many of the essays are revised versions of Auden's lectures as Professor of Poetry at Oxford University, 1956-61, and includes his inaugural lecture, &quot;Making, Knowing and Judging.&quot;\n\n\nThe two books are in PDF format:\n\n* THE DYER'S HAND &amp; OTHER ESSAYS (Random House, 1962).\n\n* SELECTED POEMS (Vintage, 1979).  Edited by Edward Mendelson.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:341df015e43437dbc792f417aeefe1f693a757ba","amp;dn":"W.+H.+Auden+-+Selected+Poetry+%26amp%3B+Prose+%282+books%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"341df015e43437dbc792f417aeefe1f693a757ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,29,240,21,228,52,55,219,199,146,244,23,174,239,225,246,147,167,87,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
