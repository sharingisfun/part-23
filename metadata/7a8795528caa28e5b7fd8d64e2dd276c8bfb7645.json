On board are big-hearted Tom Trimble and Hermes, the look-alike robot he built. Tom immediately makes friends with pretty Alisande and enemies with the awful knight Sir Nordred. It seems Nordred is out to oust Arthur, while Alisande's father is not the goose she believes him to be but is also a victim of Nordred's schemes. It's as well the Americans have arrived.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a8795528caa28e5b7fd8d64e2dd276c8bfb7645","amp;dn":"Disney%27s+Unidentified+Flying+Oddball+1979.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a8795528caa28e5b7fd8d64e2dd276c8bfb7645","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,135,149,82,140,170,40,229,183,253,141,100,226,221,39,108,139,251,118,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
