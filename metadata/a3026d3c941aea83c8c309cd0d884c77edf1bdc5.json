Located at 222 West 23rd Street, between Seventh and Eighth Avenues, in the Manhattan neighborhood of Chelsea, the 250-unit hotel has been the home of numerous writers, musicians, artists and actors, including Bob Dylan, Virgil Thomson, Brigid Berlin, Charles Bukowski, Janis Joplin, Leonard Cohen, Patti Smith, Iggy Pop, Viva, Gaby Hoffmann, Jobriath, and Larry Rivers. Though the Chelsea no longer accepts new long-term residencies, the building is still home to many who lived there before the change in policy. As of August 1, 2011, the hotel is closed for renovations.\n\nArthur C. Clarke wrote 2001: A Space Odyssey while staying at the Chelsea, and poets Allen Ginsberg, and Gregory Corso chose it as a place for philosophical and artistic exchange. It is also known as the place where the writer Dylan Thomas was staying when he died of pneumonia on November 9, 1953, and where Nancy Spungen, girlfriend of Sid Vicious of the Sex Pistols, was found stabbed to death on October 12, 1978. Arthur Miller has written a short piece, &quot;The Chelsea Affect&quot;, describing life at The Chelsea in the early 1960s.\n\nThe building has been a designated New York City landmark since 1966, and on the National Register of Historic Places since 1977.\n\nThis comilation is to celebrate this incredible Hotel...\n\n.:Traklist:.\n\nAlbergo a ore - Herbert Pagani\n\nSara - Bob Dylan\nChelsea Morning - Joni Mitchell\nChelsea Hotel '78 - Alejandro Escovedo\nChelsea Hotel #2 - Leonard Cohen\nChelsea Girl - Nico\nGodspeed - Anberlin\nBear - The Antlers\nLike A Drug I Never Did Before - Joey Ramone\nAlbum Of The Year - The Good Life\nBruce Wayne Campbell Interviewed on the Roof of the Chelsea Hotel, 1979 - Okkervil River\nMidnight In Chelsea - Bon Jovi\nHotel Chelsea Night - Ryan Adams\nThe Chelsea Hotel - Graham Nash\nThird Week in the Chelsea - Jefferson Airplane\nSad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands - Bob Dylan\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a3026d3c941aea83c8c309cd0d884c77edf1bdc5","amp;dn":"AA.+VV.+-+Chelsea+Hotel+Songs+%5BMp3+320+kbps%5D%5BTNTVillage%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a3026d3c941aea83c8c309cd0d884c77edf1bdc5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,2,109,60,148,26,234,131,200,195,9,205,13,136,76,119,237,241,189,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
