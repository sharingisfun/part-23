Sherwin VINE VOICE&quot;]\n\nTeresa Brewer sang beautifully and she entertained millions of people throughout her lifetime. Teresa's voice is in excellent form throughout this CD; and just one listen proves it!\n\nThe track set begins with one of Teresa's very early hits entitled &quot;Music! Music! Music!&quot; Teresa's voice, clear as a bell, gets the perfect accompaniment from the musicians on keyboards, brass and percussion. I predict that you will enjoy &quot;Music! Music! Music!&quot; very much.\n\n&quot;You Send Me&quot; begins with a great musical flourish; and when Teresa comes in this number takes flight! The backup choir bolsters Teresa's performance; and the brass works wonders for &quot;You Send Me.&quot; Great! &quot;Empty Arms&quot; begins with the backup choir singing a few words; and Teresa bats this one straight out of the ballpark for a grand slam home run! Moreover, &quot;I Gotta Go Get My Baby&quot; showcases Teresa's fine ability to handle a country song flawlessly.\n\n&quot;Ricochet&quot; sports a great beat; and the upbeat melody belies the seriousness of the lyrics as Teresa sings of a man who left her because he didn't truly love her. &quot;Ricochet&quot; has great drums, flute and guitar, too! &quot;Pledging My Love&quot; reverts back to a more traditional love ballad; and Teresa sings this without a superfluous note!\n\n&quot;Bo Weevil&quot; features Teresa singing another country flavored ballad; Teresa makes her rendition the definitive rendition of this classic ballad! The backup choir works wonders for &quot;Bo Weevil,&quot; too. The CD ends with a number called &quot;A Tear Fell;&quot; Teresa sings this marvelously and the backup choir enhances the natural beauty of this number. I like the strings on &quot;A Tear Fell,&quot; too.\n\nThe liner notes have an excellent, informative essay by Leonard Feather; and we get the song credits, too. Very good!\n\nAlthough Teresa is no longer with us, she will live on forever through these great songs. Teresa Brewer fans will enjoy this CD even though they could have added an extra track or two. I also recommend this CD for people who enjoy classic pop vocals.[/quote]\n\n[img]http://extraimago.com/images/2015/07/04/Folder0a390.md.jpg[/img]\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n   Teresa Brewer - The Best of Teresa Brewer (MCAD-1545)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Jacobs, Dick Orchestra\nAlbum................: The Best of Teresa Brewer (MCAD-1545)\nGenre................: Vocal\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1983\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.3.0 20130526\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: 48 %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       Tracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n   1.
