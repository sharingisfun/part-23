That includes Jimi and Jerry ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCaptain TripsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Garcia. Sly was riding high on the charts with the incredible Stand! album and was starting to get really carried away with cocaine and his ego.\n\nListening to the full performance of Sly &amp; The Family StoneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s full set from Woodstock, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s easy to see why he got so nuts. HereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a band at their peak kicking ass at 3:30AM waking up all the hippies and forcing them to boogie. If you could control over half a million people youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d get a little weird, too.\n\nIf this had been released in the aftermath of the Woodstock festival it would be rated as one of the greatest live albums ever. \n\nAfter a brief tune up, Sly fires up a chant of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œhey hey heyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and the band comes crashing in with a ferocious version of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Lady.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ What a blast of fresh air it must have been to hear this music after a full day of psychedelic rock guitar solos. Music like this forces you to stand up and get down and forget all about the silly hippy dancing. ThereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s never been a band that sounds like this before or since. SlyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s mix of pop, rock, soul, gospel and funk caused everyone from Miles Davis to The Beatles to stop and rethink their shit. Larry GrahamÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s bass playing revolutionized the instrument and the way he locks in with the incredible drumming of Greg Errico is unmatched to this day. Sly, his sister Rose on keyboards, brother Freddie on guitar blend their voices like the Staple Singers on acid. Add to that the simple but effective horns of Jerry Martini and Cynthia Robinson and youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve got the sound that changed the world.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSing a Simple Song,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œYou Can Make It If You Try,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œEveryday PeopleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDance To the MusicÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ are faster and louder than the studio versions but sacrifice none of the groove. Turn it up loud enough and you can literally hear all the brain cells exploding in harmony. They run all the songs into each other building it up to the climax of the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMusic Lover/HigherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ medley thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s one of the stand outs of the original Woodstock movie. Sly brings the band down and starts up a call and response saying ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI wanna take you higherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and the crowd roars ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHIGHER!ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ When the band comes back in the crowd goes nuts. This is all a set up for an insane 10 minute version of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI Want To Take You Higher.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nDisc 1:\n\n   1. Stand! 3:07    \n   2.
