Yet during the last century, property rights have been increasingly curbed by courts and legislatures, as they grapple with collective vs. individual control of physical and human assets. Property ultimately involves personal control and security, as often opposed to other individual interests or the overall interest or advantage of society. How are possessions legitimately acquired, used, and sold? Are property rights based on human agreement, on the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œnatural orderÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ of things, or on a divine law? \n\nThe Morality in Our Age series examines the historical and philosophical background of todayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most pressing moral challenges. Though a final ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œanswerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is notoriously elusive in moral discussion, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll develop a much better insight into the forces and principles at play on todayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most serious moral issues, problems, and dilemmas. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1752a1c516f652e0fdc51ecc1ff4d57fff084f87","amp;dn":"Property+%28Unabridged%29.m4b","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1752a1c516f652e0fdc51ecc1ff4d57fff084f87","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,82,161,197,22,246,82,224,253,197,30,204,31,244,213,127,255,8,79,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
