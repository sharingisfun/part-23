This album features songs from the very beginning of the band's career (1975) through the Powerslave era (1984), while counterpart A Real Live One only contains songs from the post-Powerslave albums.\n\nWhen Iron Maiden re-released all their albums in 1998, this album was combined with A Real Live One to form the 2-disc A Real Live Dead One.\n\nThe album cover was made by long-time Iron Maiden cover artist Derek Riggs, and depicts Eddie as a disc jockey in Hell, playing old Maiden tunes.\n\n&quot;Hallowed Be Thy Name&quot; was released as a live single. On the Billboard Music Charts, &quot;Hallowed Be Thy Name&quot; hit number 50 on the Mainstream Rock chart.\n\nTrack Listing:\n\n1. \t&quot;The Number of the Beast&quot;   \t  \n2. \t&quot;The Trooper&quot;   \t  \t\n3. \t&quot;Prowler&quot;   \t  \t\n4. \t&quot;Transylvania&quot;   \t  \n5. \t&quot;Remember Tomorrow&quot;   \t\n6. \t&quot;Where Eagles Dare&quot;   \t  \n7. \t&quot;Sanctuary&quot;   \t\n8. \t&quot;Running Free&quot;   \t\n9. \t&quot;Run to the Hills&quot;   \t  \t\n10. \t&quot;2 Minutes to Midnight&quot;   \t\n11. \t&quot;Iron Maiden&quot;   \t  \n12. \t&quot;Hallowed Be Thy Name&quot;  \n\nAnother great live album from Iron Maiden, I love this one because it has songs from Paul Di'Anno era singed by Bruce Dickinson and also has a very cool version of Transylvania, an Instrumental song by Maiden. The only drawback from this album is that Adrian Smith wasn't in the band at the time but still is very good. Enjoy and seed please.\n\nPlease take a minute and leave you comments if you like my torrents.
