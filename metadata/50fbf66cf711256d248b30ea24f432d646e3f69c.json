Some crossfading was\ndone on these tracks to blend in the crowd. These 3 tracks from the record are marked at the end of the \nfile name with &quot;(from LP)&quot;. Also the Leslie West tracks have added extra intros and Leslie talking to \nthe crowd. These were taken from the NOTG DVD and blended in front of both tracks.\n\nEnjoy the extra music - \nLiquidSkyMan\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nThis album was the best of a three hour concert, featuring nine of the world's \ngreatest rock guitarists. \n\nEach guitarist performed four songs, often with the help of another guitarist, \nmaking these songs truly one-of-a-kind. \n\nLeslie chose Theme From An Imaginary Western, and boy did he play it!  It \nwas easily his best version of it, with two solos that just will blow you away!  \nThe tone and the vibrato are at least two notches above first rate. This song \nis worth the price of admission alone. Also from the LP is Never In My Life, this\ntrack is one of the most powerful versions of this song ever! And such a clear\nrecording too. \n\nThe rest of the album is not chopped liver, however.  Alvin Lee, a personal \nfriend of Leslie, proves that Alvin is to lightening, what Leslie is to thunder.  \nAlvin plays unbelievable fast, seemingly like he's trying to play seven notes \nahead of himself and work his way back.  But it sounds GREAT! \n\nRobby Krieger shows he hasn't missed a beat since Jim Morrison's untimely \ndeath.  His latest version of Love Me Two Times is a classic, with an ultra-cool \nintro. \n\nThis concert also produced a video by the same name. Leslie performed two \nsongs, Never in My Life (again, his best version ever, in my opinion), and a \n1950's rock medley with Alvin Lee and Ted Turner.  It was so magnetic to see \nthunder and lightning on the same stage, in the bodies of Leslie and Alvin.  \nThese two should have definitely teamed up, they'd  have made a great \nteam... \n\nUnfortunately, I.R.S. discontinued the Video AND the CD, and the world can \nno longer hear this amazing concert. Shame on you I.R.S., I guess you had \nother ideas... \n\nYou can write to: \n\nI.R.S.
