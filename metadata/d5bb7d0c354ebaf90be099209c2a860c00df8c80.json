After his surprisingly glorious honeymoon in Paris, life is almost normal for Dexter Morgan. Married life seems to agree with him: he's devoted to his bride, his stomach is full, and his homicidal hobbies seem nicely under control. But old habits die hard - and Dexter's work as a blood spatter analyst never fails to offer new temptations that appeal to his offbeat sense of justice...and his Dark Passenger still waits to hunt with him in the moonlight. Luckily for Dex, there's someone out there with particularly twisted tastes. Dexter may have never been a big fan of art - but the discovery of a corpse (artfully displayed as a sunbather relaxing on a beach chair) naturally piques his curiosity. Miami's finest soon realize they've got a terrifying new serial killer on the loose. And Dexter, of course, is back in business. From the most original voice in crime fiction, Dexter By Design is an enthralling, macabre and gruesomely entertaining thriller","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d5bb7d0c354ebaf90be099209c2a860c00df8c80","amp;dn":"Dexter+by+Design+-+Jeff+Lindsay-viny","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d5bb7d0c354ebaf90be099209c2a860c00df8c80","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,187,125,12,53,78,186,249,11,224,153,32,156,42,134,12,0,223,140,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
