They themselves buy the commodities that enslave them every day more. Slaves procure alienating jobs that are bestowed upon the tamed. They, themselves, choose the masters whom they will obey. For this absurd tragedy to play-out, it has been necessary to breed in them the ignorance of their own exploitation and alienation. Behold the bizarre modernity of our time. As with the slaves of antiquity, serfs of the Middle Ages or the working-class of the first industrial revolutions, today we bear witness to an emerging class of the totally enslaved. The difference being that they donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t know it or better yet choose to ignore it. They fail to recognize the one weapon available to the enslaved: rebellion. Slaves accept without question the pitiful life that was manufactured on their behalf. Apathy and resignation are the sources of their misfortune.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3696df59863dbca8f6382855452dff5fafc43e96","amp;dn":"On+modern+servitude","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3696df59863dbca8f6382855452dff5fafc43e96","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,150,223,89,134,61,188,168,246,56,40,85,69,45,255,95,175,196,62,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
