It was recorded in 2006 in Romania but was never intended to be an album, but rather the drunken musical ramblings of two young guys.  If you are easily offended, then you should probably not download this.  Some songs are funny, racy, or just plain stupid as they were all recorded live and nearly all of the songs are an improvisational wreck with moments of pure musical sugar and ingenious lyrical reprehensibility.
