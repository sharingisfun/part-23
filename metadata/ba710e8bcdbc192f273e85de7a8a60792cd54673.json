With a friendly tone and clear, understandable instruction, photographer and educator Jen Bebb introduces you to every mode and setting on your sophisticated dSLR. After thoroughly explaining shutter speed, aperture, depth of field, ISO, and basic composition, she offers direction on what each camera mode does and when it should be used. You will gain the confidence to use the entire feature set you paid for.\n\nBeginning dSLR users are often intimidated by the scene, semi-automatic, and fully manual modes on their cameras; this guide gently explains each mode and setting.\n\nUses a conversational tone and liberal examples to define and explain basic concepts including shutter speed, aperture, ISO, depth of field, and composition.\n\nCovers how each camera mode works and when to consider using it.\n\nHelps those new to dSLR photography to gain confidence and begin taking advantage of all the flexibility a dSLR offers.\n\nWritten by a professional photographer who is also known for her skill as an instructor, Beyond Auto Mode encourages new and less experienced dSLR users to take the next step toward creative control.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba710e8bcdbc192f273e85de7a8a60792cd54673","amp;dn":"Beyond+Auto+Mode","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba710e8bcdbc192f273e85de7a8a60792cd54673","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,113,14,139,205,188,25,47,39,62,133,222,122,138,96,121,44,213,70,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
