Then we discovered a problem - many of the greatest songs are only about 60-90 sec long. So we extended them, by some simple editing, trying to push all the shorter ones toward the 3 minute mark, at least. We slapped some cover art on them, and here it is.\n\nHope you like! &lt;3\n\n(We know there are a few songs missing, but we were unable to find them.)\n\n/K&amp;Y","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:176cb1ef55d24ad6064c035c3aea2163176c1987","amp;dn":"Castle+Crashers+Soundtrack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"176cb1ef55d24ad6064c035c3aea2163176c1987","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,108,177,239,85,210,74,214,6,76,3,92,58,234,33,99,23,108,25,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
