Lancia S4, Peugeot 205T16, Lancia 037, Audi S1, Metro 6R4....\nProper!!!!\n\nMonte Carlo Rally 1986 (2008) [DVDRip (DivX)]\n\n\n\n==== INTRODUCTION ====\n\nThis is a DVDRip of the &quot;Duke&quot; DVD &quot; Monte Carlo Rally 1986 &quot;.\n\n==== Description ====\n\nExperience one of the most dramatic years in the history of the Monte-Carlo Rally with this comprehensive look at the 1986 World Rally Championship season-opener. Packed with incredible action footage from the historic mountain stages, plus interviews with legendary drivers and jaw-dropping slow-motion film, this is the complete story of an unforgettable event.\nThe '86 Monte-Carlo Rally was the first round of what would prove to be the very last year of the awesomely powerful Group B 'supercars'. Enjoy the sights - and incredible sounds - of the Martini Lancia Delta S4, Audi Quattro S1, Peugeot 206 T16 and Metro 6R4 as they do battle.\nLancia's Henri Toivonen and co-driver Sergio Cresto took advantage of their Pirelli tyres in the opening stages to establish a healthy lead, but reigning World Champion Timo Salonen and Monte-Carlo expert Walter Rohrl were soon piling on the pressure.\nToivonen looked certain for victory, until a bizarre accident involving a spectator's car cost him the lead. However, the Finnish star refused to be beaten and clawed back the lost time to take a dominant victory.\nTragically, this would be the final victory for the popular Toivonen and co-driver Cresto. This look back at the '86 Monte-Carlo Rally is a fitting tribute to the pair, as well as a real feast of classic rallying action\nMonte-Carlo Rally 1986 is part of a collectable set of classic Monte-Carlo rally highlights programmes.\n\n\n==== VIDEO/AUDIO DETAILS ====\nDuration:             58:43.440          \nFile Size:            951 MB        \nRelease Date:         10 March 2008      \nProduction Company:   Duke\n\n=== VIDEO INFO ===\nVideo Codec Name:     DivX 5.x/6.x (DX50)\nVideo Bitrate:        1996 kbps\nResolution:           688 x 560\nframes Per Second:    25 fps\n\n=== AUDION INFO ===\nAudio Codec:          0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3            \nAudio Bitrate:        48000Hz  256 kb/s , Stereo ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b2b3e4de8cb08130edbeca77ba8d02a71914ed86","amp;dn":"Monte+Carlo+Rally+1986.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b2b3e4de8cb08130edbeca77ba8d02a71914ed86","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,179,228,222,140,176,129,48,237,190,202,119,186,141,2,167,25,20,237,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
