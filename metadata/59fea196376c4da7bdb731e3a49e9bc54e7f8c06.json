DTS audio will typically NOT play on TVs that allow movies to be played directly from a flash drive or hard drive.\n\nSo I ripped out the subtitles and converted the sound so it will now play on a USB-compatible TV\n\nFile size is only 1.35GB. Great quality, or I would not be seeding...\n\nOne last thought - please help seed when you can - this is a very nice hi-def quality yet small file-size version...\n\nBUT, I only have an internet connection which is leeched from a neighbor (wi-fi) so connection sometimes drops. I will seed as best I can until some of you guys with permanent connections can also seed. Thanks...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:59fea196376c4da7bdb731e3a49e9bc54e7f8c06","amp;dn":"The.Green.Hornet.2011.Hi-Def.1280x528.BRRip.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"59fea196376c4da7bdb731e3a49e9bc54e7f8c06","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,254,161,150,55,108,77,167,189,183,49,227,164,158,155,197,78,127,140,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
