Hartman is heard in peak form throughout these 11 pieces, which include &quot;In the Wee Small Hours of the Morning,&quot; &quot;Sleepin&amp;#039; Bee,&quot; &quot;Stairway to the Stars,&quot; and even &quot;Charade.&quot; Tenor saxophonist Illinois Jacquet is on five of the songs, guitarists Kenny Burrell and Jim Hall help out on a few tunes, and Hartman is consistently accompanied by pianist Hank Jones, bassist Milt Hinton, and drummer Elvin Jones. This is one of his finest recordings.\n\nPersonnel: \nJohnny Hartman -Vocals\nMilt Hinton - Bass\nJim Hall - Guitar\nIllinois Jacquet - Sax (Tenor)\nElvin Jones - Drums\nHank Jones - Piano\n\nTrack Listing:\n1.Charade\n2.In The Wee Small Hours Of The Morning\n3.Sleepin&amp;#039; Bee\n4.Don&amp;#039;t You Know I Care\n5.Kiss &amp; Run\n6.If I&amp;#039;m Lucky\n7.I Just Dropped By To Say Hello\n8.Stairway To The Stars\n9.Our Time\n10.Don&amp;#039;t Call It Love\n11.How Sweet It Is To Be In Love","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:20504935e811d6a02dfe901318fa9d285b13ca94","amp;dn":"Johnny+Hartman+-+I+Just+Dropped+by+to+Say+Hello+%28Impulse%21%2C+1963%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"20504935e811d6a02dfe901318fa9d285b13ca94","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,80,73,53,232,17,214,160,45,254,144,19,24,250,157,40,91,19,202,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
