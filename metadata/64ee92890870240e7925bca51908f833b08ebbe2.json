Going against expectations this 33-minute short tells the story of a young boy (played by actress Daiko Ishimaru) who refuses to accept his own death. Without a doubt the death of a child is a tragic circumstance, but &quot;Twilight&quot; isn't a film heavy with mourning. Instead our protagonist goes on a wonder filled chase sequence that includes such road blocks as a diabolical witch, a pesky coffin that keeps popping out from around corners, and &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot;-esque recurring cut-outs of his face that appear on walls, in windows, and of course the numerous actors cast by Amano. There's even a scene that has the boy watching Amano's film in a movie theatre. With Amano incorporating stop-motion animation and shooting the entire film at 18 frames per second as opposed to the standard 24fps &quot;Twilight&quot; ends up coming across as a giddy mix of avant-garde Shuji Terayama and &quot;Keystone Cops&quot; Mack Sennett.\n&quot;Twilight&quot; won the grand prize of the International Short Film Festival Oberhausen and the Melbourne International Film Festival (Short Film Programme).\n\n\nRip specs:\n\n\nFormat            : AVI at 1 671 Kbps\nLength            : 399 MiB for 33mn 23s 835ms\n\nVideo #0          : MPEG-4 Visual at 1 556 Kbps\nAspect            : 592 x 448 (1.321) at 23.976 fps\n\nAudio #0          : MPEG Audio at 102 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\nLanguage          : japanese","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:64ee92890870240e7925bca51908f833b08ebbe2","amp;dn":"Twilight+-+1994+-+Tengai+Amano","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"64ee92890870240e7925bca51908f833b08ebbe2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,238,146,137,8,112,36,14,121,37,188,165,25,8,248,51,176,142,187,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
