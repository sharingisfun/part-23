There were at least 22 songs in the show every night, but over 26 months the set list was continually reinvented. By the last night more than fifty songs had featured, stretching from 2009's No Line On The Horizon all the way back to 1980's debut Boy.\r\n\r\nFrom The Ground Up: U2.com Music Edition brings you the inside track on U2360Â° - the stories, the photos, the music. Presented in a bespoke, wrap-around sleeve, the large-format 254-page hardback book opens to reveal an exclusive limited edition U2360Â° lithograph set of the band, some very cool bookmarks and Edge's Picks From U2360Â° - a limited-edition, 15-track live CD, curated by The Edge. These are the cuts asked for after the one-off release of U22. In addition to From The Ground Up: U2.com Music Edition containing Edge's Picks From U2360Â°, five bonus U2360Â° downloads were also made available - No Line On The Horizon, Spanish Eyes, Desire, Pride (In The Name Of Love) and Angel Of Harlem - tracks that are not on U22 and not on this new CD.\r\n\r\nFor subscribers only, this music edition of From The Ground Up containing the Edge's Picks From U2360Â° CD will not become commercially available.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTracklist:\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n01.
