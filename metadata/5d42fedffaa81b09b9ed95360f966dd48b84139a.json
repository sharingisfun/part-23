The fraction that is able to seize control of the twelve holy temples and simultaneously light fires on each of them, appoints the new emperor and decides on the destiny of all.\n\nIn the latest war of succession the House of Telit used nuclear weapons for the first time, nearly destroying the planet in the process. Anyone that could afford it, fled to the neighboring planet Rhea, among them the newly elected emperor. Those left behind on the planet, have established a new civilization. They call themselves The Residents and refuse to accept that their recovering planet will be once again used as the arena of a bloody competition.\n\nBattle World: Kronos is a classic turn-based strategy game in the tradition of Battle Isle, Advance Wars and Panzer General. Have you ever wondered what games like that would look like today? Well, we did. As a result, we decided to develope Battle Worlds: Kronos.\n\nAll users who buy the game will receive the DLC Ã¢â‚¬Å“TrainsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in early 2014, featuring a new campaign (~10 hours), additional multiplayer maps, and new units.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/d34dbfb70c6fe16f2fade6499faf04498e362211.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/d34dbfb70c6fe16f2fade6499faf04498e362211.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nInstall and Play.\n\nOther:\nGenre:........................................strategy / turn-based / sci-fi\nDownload size:........................... 890 MB\nRelease date:.............................November 4, 2013\nCompatible with:........................Windows (XP, Vista, 7, 8)\nLanguages:................................English\nDeveloper / Publisher:................KING Art Games\nGame modes:.............................single-player, multi-player\nMultiplayer notice: In order to access the multiplayer portion of the game, you must first enter your unique CD-key and set up an account with King Art Games via the in-game interface.
