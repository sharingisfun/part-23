That torrent has a video file with the title 'i've.loved.you.so.long.avi' and a subtitle file with the title 'i've.loved.you.so.long.srt'.  However the subtitle file in that torrent is flawed and the result is that the second half of the film (starting at around 50 minutes to the end) plays without subtitles.\n\nI have corrected the subtitle file, which is the one enclosed in this torrent.  The file named 'i've.loved.you.so.long.srt' that is in THIS torrent will play the subtitles until the end of the movie when it is put in the same folder as the video (.avi) file of the earlier torrent I uploaded for this film.\n\nSo download this torrent and then copy the file 'i've.loved.you.so.long.srt' from this torrent and paste it into the folder of the earlier torrent to replace the version of 'i've.loved.you.so.long.srt' that is in your folder from that download.\n\nNote that the correct srt file that is in this torrent is 100KB in size and the flawed (wrong) srt file that is in the earlier torrent is only 43KB in size.  \n\nLeave me a message here if you have any questions or problem to make the correction.\n\nI hope that you enjoy the movie\n\nNote that The earlier torrent with the correct (and very high quality) video plus the incomplete (flawed) subtitle file that you will replace with this one is at: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4721803/I_ve_Loved_You_So_Long.2008.Avi_(Good_English_subtitles)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4721803/I_ve_Loved_You_So_Long.2008.Avi_(Good_English_subtitles)&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0946d6d6c91de1b50685857668bdaaba25e411df","amp;dn":"CORRECT+ENGLISH+SUBTITLES+%28only%29+for+I%5C%27ve.Loved.You.So.Long","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0946d6d6c91de1b50685857668bdaaba25e411df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,70,214,214,201,29,225,181,6,133,133,118,104,189,170,186,37,228,17,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
