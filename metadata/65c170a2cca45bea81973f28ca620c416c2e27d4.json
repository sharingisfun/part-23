How have you run the race, are you running well? One day we will stand before God to give an account of the race we've run.\n\nState of the Union 2013 by Todd Wagner, 8/25/13:\nWe continue to struggle when we are not informed by scripture. God doesn't want us to be on our own, nor live inauthentic lives before one another. God is sufficient, faithful and enduring and He desires a relationship with us.\n\nCome, Commune, Connect, Change for the Glory of Christ by Todd Wagner, 8/18/13:\nOur little while may be tough, but in the midst of that while we can have great joy. We discuss how people change, how you can do something with your little while and be the person that God wants you to be, in all the fullness that God intended for you. &quot;7 Have nothing to do with irreverent, silly myths. Rather train yourself for godliness; 8 for while bodily training is of some value, godliness is of value in every way, as it holds promise for the present life and also for the life to come.&quot; 1 Timothy 4:7-8\n\nLegacy of Leadership by Scott Coy, 6/9/13:\nThe Bible provides blueprints for church leadership, not just any man should lead a church, but men of good reputation who are lead by the spirit, and know the word of God. In this sermon we discuss the roles of elders and leadership at Watermark.\n\nA Word for Those Who Aren't Home Yet - 12 Lessons From Daniel by Tommy Nelson,   6/2/13:\nTommy Nelson of Denton Bible Church (dentonbible.org) joins us and shares some great truths from the book of Daniel. How are we the church to live amongst a post-modern America? Tommy takes us through 12 lessons from the life of Daniel who, like us, is living in a land that is not his home.\n\nRun and Don't Grow Weary by Jonathan Pokluda,  05/26/13:\nIn the letter to the Hebrews, the author reminds them of the &quot;great cloud of witnesses&quot; who have gone before them. They suffered, struggled, and endured coming out the other side saying &quot;He is worth it!&quot; What hindrances in your life are keeping you from running like the patriarchs in Hebrews 11?\n\nA Living Picture of Luke 15:4-7: Baptism Celebration 2013 by Todd Wagner, 05/05/13:\n&quot;What man among you, if he has a hundred sheep and has lost one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine in the open pasture and go after the one which is lost until he finds it? When he has found it, he lays it on his shoulders, rejoicing. And when he comes home, he calls together his friends and his neighbors, saying to them, 'Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep which was lost!' I tell you that in the same way, there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who need no repentance.&quot; (Luke 15:4-7)\n\nTodd Wagner and Phil Vischer (Creator of Veggie Tales and What's in the ... by Todd Wagner and Phil Vischer, 05/03/13 :\nA conversation about hope, life, work, and parenting.\n\nThe Greatest Story Ever Told by Todd Wagner, 03/31/13:\nAll great stories point to the ultimate story. We see Christ in the stories of the Old Testament, in classic fairy tails, and even in box office blockbusters. We are drawn to redemption stories and they are all just a picture of the greatest redemption story ever told: Jesus defeating death and redeeming us to Himself! He is risen indeed!\n\nAliens and Strangers on Mission - Reclaiming the &quot;M&quot; Word by Todd Wagner, 01/20/13:\nIf you are part of the body of Jesus Christ then you are a missionary, an alien in this world. We must remember that no matter where we are we are on mission. The ones who are faithful on mission around the world are the same ones who are faithful here.\n\nA Beautiful Commitment by Jonathan Pokluda, 01/13/13:\nDo you take your commitments too lightly? The things we commit to and our follow through with them matter to God. We as Christ followers should be known for our reliability and honesty. We should keep our word even when it hurts.\n\nFollow Jesus Not Your Passions by Todd Wagner, 01/06/13:\nA prevailing phrase in American culture is &quot;follow your passion&quot;. However, scripture screams &quot;Don't follow your passions! Follow Jesus!&quot; It is our nature to follow our passions, but we must be intentional about pursuing Christ.\n\n\n\nThis is in memory of my Mom who passed at 11:44 pm PST ON 1-25-2011. Now she knows.\n\nJESUS: Believe this about Jesus to move on to Greener Pastures.\n\nBorn of a Virgin, He was killed for our transgressions, His blood was shed as a sacrifice to atone for my sins. He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.\n\nRAPtURE (My transportation outta here).\n\nThe Blessed Hope.  If you believe in The Rapture you better believe The Above Statement and that the Sacrificed Blood of Jesus, on the Cross paid for your sins and there is NOTHING Else you can do to gain Salvation, The GRACE of Christ did it ALL. Now you just have to believe that with all your Heart, Mind and Soul or Maybe Get Left Behind. All PAST, Present and Future Sins are Forgiven with Jesus. (I wouldn't PUSH That Future sin statement to much!!!)\n\nIn a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed...\n\n&quot;And He will send forth His angels with A GREAT TRUMPET and THEY WILL GATHER TOGETHER His elect from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.\n\n&quot;Do not marvel at this; for an hour is coming, in which all who are in the tombs will hear His voice,  Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in The Air, and there we will be forever be with him...hmmm sounds like some of us might be Immortal. (Ask your preacher about that)\n\n\nMay Yahweh Bless You as He has me. Seed long and Prosper from the Blessings of our Lord. I have asked the Father to Bless all those that Seed Long.  \n\nDo Not believe anything you find here, search the Scriptures daily to determine the TRUTH.
