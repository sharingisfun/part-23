Sisely Treasure from the band Cooler Kids replaced\n   departed vocalist Carah Faye Charnow who left the group this past summer to\n   pursue other interests. With a new singer who is also now a writing partner\n   to Petree and Dawson, Treasure brings in a whole new complimentary\n   perspective to the band. The result is a hard rocking, groove shaking album\n   that will appeal to die hard SHINY TOY GUNS fans and new ones alike.\n\n- Track List ---------------------------------------------------------------- -\n\n  01.
