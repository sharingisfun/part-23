A very good show overall, although a feeling of sloppiness is especially evident in Jimmy's playing. The great late J. J. Jackson had opened that evening: &quot;Good evening! My name is J. J. Jackson of KWLOS. We're all here towelcome back to the LA area ... Led Zeppelin!&quot; After a rather brilliant opening section, Dazed And Confused suffers from Jimmy playing badly out of time with the rhythm section during the improvisations, and he doesn't correct it either! This makes for a jerky and uneasy listening experience. The closer is excellent and although The Crunge jam in Whole Lotta Love is good and the \r\nmost complete version ever performed, Jimmy is lost and it shows! Licking Stick follows and is driven by the rhythm section into the Theremin solo which, as always, starts Jones amazing bass and Bonham's splendid drumming. A very good version of Heartbreaker closes the show (&quot;Children Of The Sun! Good night!&quot;). Beside that, this is a glorious return to the LA and the band was on. Plant: &quot;This is the place, this is the one. There are the last three gigs on our American tour and so we intend them to be something of a high point for us. Obviously, we don't achieve that without a little bit of a vibe, that I can already feel, and a few smiles.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f04382829fa196d15b16efe17f5ccb937e485d86","amp;dn":"Led+Zeppelin+-+1975.03.24+Los+Angeles%2C+California+MP3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f04382829fa196d15b16efe17f5ccb937e485d86","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,67,130,130,159,161,150,209,91,22,239,225,127,92,203,147,126,72,93,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
