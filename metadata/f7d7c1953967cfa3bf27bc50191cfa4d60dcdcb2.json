It contains tracks from:\n\nCraps (After Hours)\nStudio album by Richard Pryor \nReleased 1971\nRecorded 1971\nGenre Stand-up comedy \n\n\nThat Nigger&amp;#039;s Crazy\nStudio album by Richard Pryor \nReleased May 1974 \nRecorded early 1974 San Francisco \nGenre Stand-up comedy\n \n\nÃƒÂ¢?Ã‚Â¦Is It Something I Said? \nStudio album by Richard Pryor \nReleased 1975 \nRecorded The Latin Casino, Cherry Hill, New Jersey \nGenre Comedy \n\n\n\n\n\n---------------------------\n---------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\nJust to clarify, this is Greatest Hits, a compilation of all three of those albums listed abovea and released in 1977, not all three seperate albums.\n\nOften called the greatest stand-up comic of all time, Pryor&amp;#039;s style is clearly as influential today as it was in the 1970s. Eddie Murphy and Chris Rock are obviously deeply influenced by Pryor&amp;#039;s comedy, Murphy often quoting and doing impressions of Pryor particularly in Raw and Delirious.\n\nHe&amp;#039;s a brilliant stand-up, and definitely a seminal comedian worth giving a listen.\n\nYou&amp;#039;ll like this if you like Eddie Murphy, Chris Rock, Bill Cosby.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f7d7c1953967cfa3bf27bc50191cfa4d60dcdcb2","amp;dn":"Richard+Pryor%2C+Greatest+Hits+%5BComedy+Album%2C+mp3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f7d7c1953967cfa3bf27bc50191cfa4d60dcdcb2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,215,193,149,57,103,207,163,191,39,188,80,25,28,250,77,96,220,220,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
