Among them are H.P. Seuss, Blake Pudding, Poppy Tartt and Malcolm Eggs, who offer their musings on such varied topics as forgotten breakfast cereals of the 1980s, famous last breakfasts and Freud's famous Breakfast Dream.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:36ecccb66244adc5d421c9430f67569f44f38f67","amp;dn":"The+Breakfast+Bible+by+Seb+Emina","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"36ecccb66244adc5d421c9430f67569f44f38f67","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,236,204,182,98,68,173,197,212,33,201,67,15,103,86,159,68,243,143,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
