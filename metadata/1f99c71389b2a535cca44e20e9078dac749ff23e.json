He's worth your time even if you think the description below is of no interest to you.\n\ndescription:\n\nSet between 1950 and 1963, this coming-of-age memoir discusses one of AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most taboo subjects: social class. Combining recollections, accounts, and analysis, this book leans on Maw, Pap, Ony Mae, and other members of this rambunctious Scots-Irish family to chronicle the often heartbreaking postwar journey of 22 million rural Americans into the cities, where they became the foundation of a permanent white underclass. Telling the stories of the gun-owning, uninsured, underemployed white tribes inhabiting America's heartlands, this record offers an intimate look at what was lost in the orchestrated postwar shift from an agricultural to an urban consumer society.\n\nAbout the Author (from wikipedia):\n\nJoe Bageant (1946 - 2011) was an American author and columnist known for his book Deer Hunting With Jesus.\n\nBageant was originally raised in Winchester, Virginia. He left Winchester and worked as a journalist and editor. In 2001, Bageant moved back to Winchester.\n\nIn Deer Hunting With Jesus: Dispatches From America's Class War, Bageant discusses how Democrats have lost the political support of poor rural whites and how the Republican Party has convinced these individuals to &quot;vote against their own economic self-interest.&quot; The book is mainly centered on his hometown, Winchester.\n\nIn 2010, Bageant published a similarly themed book, Rainbow Pie: A Redneck Memoir. Bageant used his extended family's post WW II years experience to describe the social hierarchy in the United States of America. The book examines the post-war journey of 22 million rural Americans into the cities, where they became, the author argues, the foundation of a permanent white underclass and comprise much of today's heartland &quot;red state&quot; voters.\n\nBageant died of cancer in 2011.\n\n\n--------------------------------\n\nDeer Hunting with Jesus is here:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8713171&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8713171&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f99c71389b2a535cca44e20e9078dac749ff23e","amp;dn":"Joe+Bageant+-+Rainbow+Pie%3A+A+Redneck+Memoir+%28pdf%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f99c71389b2a535cca44e20e9078dac749ff23e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,153,199,19,137,178,165,53,204,164,78,32,233,7,141,172,116,159,242,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
