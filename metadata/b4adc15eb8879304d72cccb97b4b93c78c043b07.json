Boxcutter\n\n         is one such artist and his second album &amp;#039;Glyphic&amp;#039; is a\n\n         testament to this, containing a cross-generic spread of\n\n         tracks you&amp;#039;d never expect to hear from most producers on\n\n         the scene. Of course there are likely to be those who moan\n\n         at Boxcutter&amp;#039;s lack of purist ideals, but what do they\n\n         know? Here we&amp;#039;ve got rumbling bass one minute and an\n\n         analogue synth freak-out the next, with a bit of two step\n\n         and jungle thrown in there for good measure. Boxcutter\n\n         (Barry to his mates) is someone who isn&amp;#039;t afraid to think\n\n         outside the box when it comes to lapping up his listening\n\n         material, and with a genuine passion for electronica, dub,\n\n         jazz and, well, pretty much everything in-between I\n\n         suppose we were always going to end up with quite an odd\n\n         album. The fact that we kick off with something quite so\n\n         unusual as the title track &amp;#039;Glyphic&amp;#039; - an eight minute\n\n         exploration into free jazz sax and deep, deep bass - only\n\n         puts paid to these suggestions. Elsewhere we get the\n\n         purist dubstep of &amp;#039;Bug Octet&amp;#039;, the breaks-heavy &amp;#039;Rusty\n\n         Break&amp;#039; and the crackling roots of &amp;#039;J Dub&amp;#039;, but for me the\n\n         surprise highlight comes on the second half of the album\n\n         which sees Boxcutter tackling squelchy analogue\n\n         electronica. On &amp;#039;Bloscid&amp;#039; we see the producer taking\n\n         influence from Aphex Twin and Luke Vibert as he lets the\n\n         drum machine cycle and the synthesizers blurt out hooky\n\n         basslines and detuned lead, a style that pops back on\n\n         &amp;#039;Lunal&amp;#039; and for my money he&amp;#039;s taking on the big producers\n\n         and coming out on top. &amp;#039;Glyphic&amp;#039; is a great dubstep album\n\n         that manages to kick the spotty arse off a genre and shows\n\n         the world that there&amp;#039;s more to life than a rave sample and\n\n         a comedy bass line. Let&amp;#039;s hope he gets the credit he\n\n         deserves.&quot;\n\n       :                                                             :\n\n      :|                                                             |:\n\n     -:o-------------------------------------------------------------o:-\n\n      :|                       .: Tracklist :.                       |:\n\n     -:o-------------------------------------------------------------o:-\n\n      :|                                                             |:\n\n       :                                                             :\n\n         01.glyphic                                          [07:50]\n\n         02.windfall                                         [02:50]\n\n         03.bug octet                                        [05:23]\n\n         04.rusty break                                      [05:13]\n\n         05.j dub                                            [04:36]\n\n         06.chiral                                           [04:37]\n\n         07.kaleid                                           [05:31]\n\n         08.bloscid                                          [03:23]\n\n         09.foxy                                             [05:02]\n\n         10.lunal                                            [04:58]\n\n         11.fieldtrip                                        [06:33]\n\n\n\n       :                                                             :\n\n      :| 55:56 min    71,8 MB                                        |:\n\n     -:o-------------------------------------------------------------o:-\n\n      :|             .: We Send Warm Bass Vibrations to :.           |:\n\n     -:o-------------------------------------------------------------o:-\n\n      :|   Aeroholics .
