I am always as honest as i can be to what i know the source is.\n\nvideo\n1.added colour\n2.adjusted brigtness with a few filters\n3.added contour\n\naudio\n1.used audio from scr\n2.re sync'd to the r5\n\n*****help what we can with haiti...the world is ONE big family*****","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:39adf8bb944d25b1f6b7af8b0fb3a2b9748084a0","amp;dn":"The.Men.Who.Stare.At.Goats.2009.R5.LINE.XviD-SilentNinja","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"39adf8bb944d25b1f6b7af8b0fb3a2b9748084a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,173,248,187,148,77,37,177,246,183,175,139,15,179,162,185,116,128,132,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
