Just look at the setlist:\n\n01. (Gotta Get Some Action) NOW!\n02. Fake Baby\n03. Born Broke\n04. You Are Nothin&amp;#039;\n05. Ferrytale\n06. Random Riot\n07. 1995\n08. My Mephistophelean Creed\n09. Misanthropic High\n10. Soulseller\n11. Ghoul School\n12. Another Place\n13. Tilt City\n\n\nIt&amp;#039;s not a Pro-shot video, but decent quality and shot from the side of the stage. That should be enough if you just like the band. You can naturally look at the videos on Youtube.\n\nAND please support them by buying those great releases (there are no lemons) and going to the gigs - there&amp;#039;s not many left unfortunately.\n\nEnjoy!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ebe2f3c5585395b4d290b817dc6c423521765dd3","amp;dn":"The+Hellacopters+-+Live+at+Hultsfred+Festival+%2812.06.1997%29.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ebe2f3c5585395b4d290b817dc6c423521765dd3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,226,243,197,88,83,149,180,210,144,184,23,220,108,66,53,33,118,93,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
