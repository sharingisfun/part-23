SketchUp Pro is everything traditional CAD software isn't -- quick to learn and intuitive to use. \n\nCreate 3D Models\n Using SketchUp Pro, you can create 3D models, either by starting from scratch or by using existing data. Import drawings, CAD plans, photos, aerial imagery and other information, then use the modeling tools in SketchUp Pro to develop your ideas into 3D. \n\nAdd data to your model\n Within SketchUp Pro, you have the ability to add attributes to your model with Dynamic Components. At any point, create a report summarizing the attribute data in your model. Use these reports to extract quantities and take-offs throughout the evolution of your model. \n\nExport and Share\n Some projects require the use of traditional CAD applications or renderering applications to develop construction drawings, photo-realistic images or to share information. SketchUp Pro can export your 3D model in a number of 2D and 3D formats for use with other applications. \n\nPresent and Document\n For many of your projects, SketchUp Pro, which includes LayOut, is all you will need.
