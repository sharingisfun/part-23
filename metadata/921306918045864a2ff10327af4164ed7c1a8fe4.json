Yet there is a tradition of American anti-imperialism that gives the lie to this mythology. Seymour examines this complex relationship from the American Revolution to the present-day.\n\nThis event was co-sponsored by Haymarket Books and the Howard Zinn Memorial Lecture Series.\n\nRICHARD SEYMOUR is a socialist writer and columnist and runs the blog Lenin's Tomb.
