It is the 1960s and Israeli intelligence is nervous. Iran is bringing missiles out of its bunkers. Soon they will be just a &quot;push of the button&quot; away from being able to launch them at Israel. Racing against time, the head of the Mossad and a reluctantly recruited scientist work to create a nuclear option for Israel. Together with France and Germany, they must find a way to protect Israel against its potentially imminent destruction, while facing their own moral qualms about building a bomb capable of unthinkable destruction. At the time only the USA, Great Britain and Russia had the bomb. A tale of mistrust and paranoia, set in the recent past, that resonates as loudly as ever today.\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo: MPEG4 Video (H264), 720x448, 25.000 fps, 1865 Kbps, 01h43m00s\r\nAudio: Dolby AC3, 48000 Hz, stereo, 192 kbps\r\n\r\nDVDRip, Hebrew audio, optional subtitles English, Hebrew, Russian\r\n\r\ncover: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/50hgtuk1d/\r\n\r\nscreenshots: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/z91l0yqcx/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/9ozauj4z5/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/apzjjnlyp/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/th1gttgj5/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e0a2b8712c578aa52dc436fffdadbf59997f9c0f","amp;dn":"Mivtza+Hamaniya+-+Operation+Sunflower+%5B2014+-+Israel%5D+bomb+drama","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e0a2b8712c578aa52dc436fffdadbf59997f9c0f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,162,184,113,44,87,138,165,45,196,54,255,253,173,191,89,153,127,156,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
