Half the world is now covered by poisonous, rising oceans. What dry land remains is a broken, infertile world of hard ground and harder living.\n\nInto this world steps Michael, a scavenger who roams the wasteland, trading what he can salvage. But Michael's latest find will change his life for ever - a machine that talks in a forgotten language, supposedly giving directions to the fabled land of A-Ree-Yass-I, where mankind's downfall began.\n\nTRACK LIST:\n\n01.
