Published in two volumes a decade apart, Don Quixote is the most influential work of literature to emerge from the Spanish Golden Age and perhaps the entire Spanish literary canon. As a founding work of modern Western literature, it regularly appears at or near the top of lists of the greatest works of fiction ever published and is the best-selling non-religious, non-political work of fiction of all time.&quot;\n\nBob Grant dons the suit of armour as Don Quixote and Bernard Cribbins is Sancho in this enjoyable caper.\n\nDirected by Alfred Bradley\n\n----------------------------------\n\nEpisode 1\n\nCervantes' 1605 Spanish classic adventure of an intrepid knight and his humble squire.\n\nRebroadcast on BBC Radio 7, Sunday 23rd March 2008\nRebroadcast on BBC Radio 7, March 2010\nRebroadcast on BBC Radio 4 Extra, Saturday 25th June 2011 (capped)\n\nFilename : Don Quixote - part 1 of 2 (BBC, 1980).mp3\nFile size : 82.1 MiB\nDuration : 1hr 29min\nFormat : MPEG Audio\nFormat version : Version 1\nFormat profile : Layer 3\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 128 Kbps\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\n\n----------------------------------\n\nEpisode 2\n\nThe intrepid knight embarks on a new adventure with faithful companion Sancho Panza.\n\nRebroadcast on BBC Radio 7, Sunday 30th March 2008\nRebroadcast on BBC Radio 7, March 2010\nRebroadcast on BBC Radio 4 Extra, Saturday 2nd July 2011  (capped)\n\nFilename : Don Quixote - part 2 of 2 (BBC, 1980).mp3\nFile size : 82.1 MiB\nDuration : 1hr 29min\nFormat : MPEG Audio\nFormat version : Version 1\nFormat profile : Layer 3\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 128 Kbps\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f6e25eb2c1ce9dfc528c6cd8b6711aea6bc9e9af","amp;dn":"Don+Quixote+%28BBC+drama+-+radio+play%2C+1980%29+%5BWebRip+%28mp3%29%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f6e25eb2c1ce9dfc528c6cd8b6711aea6bc9e9af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,226,94,178,193,206,157,252,82,140,108,216,182,113,26,234,107,201,233,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
