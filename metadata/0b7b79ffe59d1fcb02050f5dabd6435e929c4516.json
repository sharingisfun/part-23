At first, Setzer played rockabilly covers in a band called the Tom Cats with his brother, drummer Gary, and bassist Bob Beecher; however, Setzer soon abandoned that group to join up with newly rechristened school friends Lee Rocker (born Leon Drucker) and Slim Jim Phantom (born James McDonnell). However, their retro '50s look and sound didn't go over well around Long Island, and in the summer of 1980, the group headed to England, where a rockabilly revival movement was just beginning to emerge. \n\n\nGenre................: Rockabilly Revival\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nLabel.................: Arista\nIncluded.............: Covers, auCDtect, Log\n\n\n\n01.Stray Cat Strut\n02.Rock This Town\n03.Rebels Rule\n04.Built For Speed\n05.Little Miss Prissy\n06.Too Hip Gotta To Go\n07.My One Desire\n08.I Won't Stand In Your Way\n09.C'mon Everybody (Live)\n10.Fishnet Stockings\n11.Runaway Boys\n12.(She's) Sexy + 17\n13.Baby Blue Eyes\n14.Jeannie, Jeannie, Jeannie\n15.You Don't Believe Me\n16.Ubangi Stomp\n17.Double Talkin' Baby\n18.Storm The Embassy\n19.Rumble In Brighton\n20.Gonna Ball\n\n\n\n\n\nTHANKS for Seeding!\nCheers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b7b79ffe59d1fcb02050f5dabd6435e929c4516","amp;dn":"Back+To+The+Alley+-+The+Best+Of+The+Stray+Cats+%281990%29+%7BFLAC%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b7b79ffe59d1fcb02050f5dabd6435e929c4516","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,123,121,255,229,157,31,203,2,5,15,93,171,214,67,94,146,156,69,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
