The animated title character has been framed and now he is out to clear his name with the help of a human detective (Bob Hoskins). Robert Zemeckis cemented his ability to make a film with this winner. The special effects, which are remarkable, never detract from the story and in the end they add a great dimension to this fine motion picture. Overlooked in 1988, but the best film from that weak year. 5 stars out of 5.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8924b64c7f9d71884ca6ff59a29c6fcce895766a","amp;dn":"Who+Framed+Roger+Rabbit+-+DVDRIP.XVID.AC3.DragonRipper","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8924b64c7f9d71884ca6ff59a29c6fcce895766a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,36,182,76,127,157,113,136,76,166,255,89,162,156,111,204,232,149,118,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
