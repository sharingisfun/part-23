One chapter was devoted to Los Angeles County Deputy David MarchÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½killed in cold blood by Armando Arroyo Garcia, an illegal alien with a criminal record who had been deported three times before the shooting. I documented that Hezbollah\nterrorists who entered the United States through Mexico are in federal prison today, prosecuted for sending money back to Hezbollah terrorists in Lebanon.\n\nI realized something was terribly wrong when the Bush administration took no action against the thousands of illegal immigrant protestors and their supporters who marched on May Day 2006 in American streets under the Mexican flag. \nThe only conclusion I could reach was that the Bush administration was leaving our border with Mexico and Canada wide open because that was the way the Bush administration wanted the borders.\n\nAs I worked on Minutemen, I came to suspect that President Bush had made a fundamental policy commitment when he agreed to the Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America at a summit meeting with Mexico and Canada on March 23, 2005. More than a declaration of friendship by neighboring countries, the agreements made at the Waco summit were perhaps the reason our borders with Mexico and Canada have remained so porous.\nThe argument made in The Late Great USA is that policy makers in the three nations and multinational corporations have placed the United States, Mexico, and Canada on a fast track to merge together economically and politically.\nThe goal of this book is to bring the North American integration argument into the arena of full public discourse, where the evidence can be examined, while the pros and cons are debated. A public debate is the only way to avoid seeing a North American Union created through a stealthy, incremental process in which our public policy makers are intentionally less than candid about their true intentions.\n\nI believe that an informed American public will fight to retain American sovereignty, rejecting the globalist determination to merge the United States, Mexico, and Canada on the way to a borderless &quot;free trade&quot; world. Publishing this book will test whether American patriots remain who will resist the movement toward a North American Union.\n\nJerome R.
