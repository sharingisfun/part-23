He knows that Jensen the bartender's brother died and that Gooberman the town drunk lost his wife. Garrity also reveals that he has a very peculiar gift - he can bring back the dead. When a dog is run down by a wagon in the street he resurrects it without any difficulty. When he offers to do the same for the town's loved one's, they realize they would rather he not bring back the dearly departed, something they are quite happy to pay him for. Garrity, a charlatan if ever there was one, is glad to accept their money - though he does seem to leave something behind.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d03f9afcbaff6c7ff51d1641e833dd8e0482923","amp;dn":"The+Twilight+Zone+-+Mr.+Garrity+And+The+Graves","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d03f9afcbaff6c7ff51d1641e833dd8e0482923","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,3,249,175,203,175,246,199,255,81,209,100,30,131,61,216,224,72,41,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
