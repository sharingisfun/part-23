Over 100 tools included on this disk....\n\nThis CD is meant to &quot;autoboot&quot; meaning that when the CD is placed in the tray, and your computer is rebooted or turned off/on, the system will boot to the OS located on the CD. You may have to change some BIOS settings if your computer does not look to the CD before the HD for system booting. You may also have to press a key during boot to bring up a menu to choose your boot device. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://flmsdown.net/2008/04/05/digiwiz-minipe-iso-updated-07.03.2008.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://flmsdown.net/2008/04/05/digiwiz-minipe-iso-updated-07.03.2008.html&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd53e6268805fe073fcf0104d41fb29214b7822b","amp;dn":"Mini+PE+v+2k5.09.03","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd53e6268805fe073fcf0104d41fb29214b7822b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,83,230,38,136,5,254,7,63,207,1,4,212,31,178,146,20,183,130,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
