But Wastin' Pigs Is Still Radical&quot;. They are also acclaimed for their elaborate live shows, which feature costumes, balloons, puppets, video projections, complex stage light configurations, giant hands, large amounts of confetti, and frontman Wayne Coyne's signature man-sized plastic bubble, in which he traverses the audience. In 2002, Q magazine named The Flaming Lips one of the &quot;50 Bands to See Before You Die&quot;.\n\nThe group recorded several albums and EPs on an indie label, Restless, in the 1980s and early 1990s. After signing to Warner Brothers, they scored a hit in 1993 with &quot;She Don't Use Jelly&quot;. Although it has been their only hit single in the U.S., the band has maintained critical respect and, to a lesser extent, commercial viability through albums such as 1999's The Soft Bulletin (which was NME magazine's Album of the Year) and 2002's Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots. They have had more hit singles in the UK and Europe than in the U.S. In February 2007, they were nominated for a 2007 BRIT Award in the &quot;Best International Act&quot; category. By 2007, the group garnered three Grammy Awards, including two for Best Rock Instrumental Performance.\n\nOn October 13, 2009 the group released their latest studio album, titled Embryonic. On December 22, 2009, the Flaming Lips released a remake of the 1973 Pink Floyd album The Dark Side Of The Moon.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Flaming_Lips&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Flaming_Lips&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Flaming Lips and Stardeath and White Dwarfs with Henry Rollins and Peaches Doing The Dark Side of the Moon is the thirteenth full-length studio album by the psychedelic rock group The Flaming Lips. The album is a complete track-for-track remake of Pink Floyd's seminal 1973 album The Dark Side of the Moon.\n\nThe album was released through the iTunes Store on December 22, 2009, and was released on other digital music retailers a week later.\n\nOn April 17, 2010, Warner Bros. released 5000 copies of The Flaming Lips and Stardeath and White Dwarfs with Henry Rollins and Peaches Doing The Dark Side of the Moon on 12&quot; seafoam green vinyl as part of Record Store Day. Upon release the record was released on both seafoam green and clear vinyl with a CD copy of the album included.\n\nOn December 22, The Flaming Lips released their second album of 2009, The Dark Side of the Moon, a complete remake of the 1973 album by Pink Floyd. The album features guest appearances from Stardeath and White Dwarfs, Henry Rollins and Peaches. The album is The Flaming Lips 13th studio album and their first cover album.[15]\n\nOn New Year's Eve 2009, The Flaming Lips performed their 3rd annual New Year's Eve Freakout. Opening for the Lips was Stardeath and the White Dwarfs. The Flaming Lips performed up until 11:55pm, then followed by a NYE countdown and the world's largest balloon drop. After midnight The Flaming Lips and Stardeath and White Dwarfs performed, in its entirety, Pink Floyd's The Dark Side of the Moon.\n\nThe Flaming Lips performed &quot;Dark Side Of The Moon&quot; at Bonnaroo 2010 and will headline Free Press Summer Fest on June 6, 2010 in Houston, Texas.\n\nOn April 17, 2010, Warner Bros. released 5000 copies of The Flaming Lips and Stardeath and White Dwarfs with Henry Rollins and Peaches Doing The Dark Side of the Moon on 12&quot; seafoam green vinyl as part of Record Store Day.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Flaming_Lips_and_Stardeath_and_White_Dwarfs_with_Henry_Rollins_and_Peaches_Doing_The_Dark_Side_of_the_Moon&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Flaming_Lips_and_Stardeath_and_White_Dwarfs_with_Henry_Rollins_and_Peaches_Doing_The_Dark_Side_of_the_Moon&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCD1: Live at Bonnaroo (First Set)(MP3@320)\n\nTracklist:\n\n01 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Intro\n02 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ The Fear\n03 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Worm Mountain\n04 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Silver Trembling Hands\n05 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ She DonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Use Jelly\n06 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ The Yeah, Yeah, Yeah Song\n07 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ I Can Be A Frog\n08 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots Pt. 1\n09 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ See the Leaves\n10 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Laser Hands\n11 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Pompeii Am Gotterdammerung\n12 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ (Wayne Speaks) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Taps\n13 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ The W.A.N.D.\n14 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Do You Realize\n\n\n\n\n\nCD2: Live at Bonnaroo (The Dark Side of the Moon Full Album Live)(MP3@320)\n\nTracklist:\n\n01 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Speak To Me ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Breathe (Live)\n02 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ On The Run (Live)\n03 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Time ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Breathe (Live)\n04 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ The Great Gig In The Sky (Live)\n05 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Money (Live)\n06 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Us And Them (Live)\n07 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Any Colour You Like (Live)\n08 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Brain Damage (Live)\n09 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Eclipse (Live)\n\n\n\n\n\nCD3: The Dark Side of the Moon (Studio)(Lossless FLAC &amp; MP3@320)\n\nTracklist:\n\n01 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Speak To Me ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Breathe\n02 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ On The Run\n03 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Time ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Breathe\n04 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ The Great Gig In The Sky\n05 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Money\n06 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Us And Them\n07 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Any Colour You Like\n08 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Brain Damage\n09 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Eclipse\n\n\n\n\n\nMore info:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.flaminglips.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.flaminglips.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Flaming_Lips&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Flaming_Lips&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Flaming_Lips_and_Stardeath_and_White_Dwarfs_with_Henry_Rollins_and_Peaches_Doing_The_Dark_Side_of_the_Moon&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Flaming_Lips_and_Stardeath_and_White_Dwarfs_with_Henry_Rollins_and_Peaches_Doing_The_Dark_Side_of_the_Moon&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://pitchfork.com/news/37233-flaming-lips-to-cover-pink-floyds-idark-sidei-live-on-new-years-eve/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://pitchfork.com/news/37233-flaming-lips-to-cover-pink-floyds-idark-sidei-live-on-new-years-eve/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nENJOY &amp; AS ALWAYS: REMEMBER TO KEEP SEEDING FOR OTHERS!!!\nTHANKS!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e1a771b47ed262a2efaabc9b9f2df6a09ce717d","amp;dn":"The+Flaming+Lips+-+Dark+Side+Of+The+Roo+%283CD%29%282010%29%28Live+%26+Studi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e1a771b47ed262a2efaabc9b9f2df6a09ce717d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,26,119,27,71,237,38,42,46,250,171,201,185,242,223,106,9,206,113,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
