Meanwhile, punk has become a marketing concept to sell everything from cars to vodka, and dyed hair and piercings mark a rite of passage for thousands of kids. Can the true, nonconformist punk spirit still exist in today&amp;#039;s corporatized culture?\n\nFeaturing interviews, performances, and behind-the-scenes journeys with the bands, labels, fans, and press who keep punk alive, Punk&amp;#039;s Not Dead dares to juxtapose pop-punk&amp;#039;s music and lifestyle against the roots in\nthe 70s and 80s, resulting in unexpected revelations.\n\nA DIY search for the soul of a subculture and a celebration of all things loud, fast, and spiked, Punk&amp;#039;s Not Dead shows punk is stronger and more relevant today than it&amp;#039;s ever been.\n\n\nFile info:\n=========================\nFile size.........: 700 MB\nRuntime.....:.....: 1h 35mn\n\nCodec Video.......: XviD\nVideo Bitrate.....: 123 kbps\nFPS...............: 25 fps\nResolution........: 608 x 352\n\nCodec Audio.......: MPEG Layer-3\nAudio Bitrate.....: 109 kb/s, Stereo\nSampling rate.....: 48000Hz\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1afe473d8efa5fa2ad9898740bcc4471248c9366","amp;dn":"Punk%5C%27s+Not+Dead+DVDRip+XviD-bntn","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1afe473d8efa5fa2ad9898740bcc4471248c9366","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,254,71,61,142,250,95,162,173,152,152,116,11,204,68,113,36,140,147,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
