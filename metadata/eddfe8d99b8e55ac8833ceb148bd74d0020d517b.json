The late 90s. A totalitarian fascist society. A young, innocent girl struggles  to find her place in it. A charismatic, uncompromising anarchist fights to bring it down. One of the most frighteningly powerful stories in comic book history. \n\nThis series by Alan Moore and David Lloyd originally appeared in black-and-white and was one the main features in Britain's Warrior magazine, which only lasted 26 issues. The story remained unfinished until DC bought the rights in 1988 and put out this volume, which has been colorized.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eddfe8d99b8e55ac8833ceb148bd74d0020d517b","amp;dn":"V+for+Vendetta+%2801+-+10%29+%281988+-+1989%29+%28Digital%29+%28Zone-Empire%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eddfe8d99b8e55ac8833ceb148bd74d0020d517b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,223,232,217,155,142,85,172,136,51,206,177,72,189,116,208,2,13,81,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
