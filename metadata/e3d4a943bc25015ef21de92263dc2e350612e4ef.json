It's our all-new free recording &quot;Marriage and the Eucharist&quot; by the world's most talented speaker on Pope John Paul II's Theology of the Body, Christopher West.\n\nDuring the very first years of his pontificate, Pope John Paul II layed the foundations not just for his unique reign but for the entire New Evangelization by giving over 120 talks on what he termed &quot;The Theology of the Body&quot; (TOTB) during his Wednesday addresses. You may have heard about TOTB.\n\nThis groundbreaking achievement is the culmination of JP II's lifetime of holiness, love for families, brilliance, as well as his supernatural road map for defeating the Culture of Death and bringing forth the Civilization of Love. He ardently desires for these truths to be his personal gift to you, the Church, and the entire world.\n\nAnd &quot;Marriage and the Eucharist&quot; is the best &quot;introduction&quot; to the Theology of the Body ever recordedÃ¢â‚¬â€œby the most respected and dynamic speaker in the world on the subject, Christopher West.\n\nThe pope's biographer, George Weigel, calls this gift from JP II a &quot;theological time bomb. &quot;Marriage and the the Eucharist&quot; is the bomb exploding. We call it a supernatural tidal wave, and this talk is your chance to ride it.\n\nIn short, TOTB is ground-floor stuffÃ¢â‚¬â€œthe Next Big Thing for the Next Thousand Years.\n\nIt will transform your life. We have no doubt. We waited for the Holy Spirit to send the Mary Foundation the perfect introduction, just for you, and it's called &quot;Marriage and the Eucharist.&quot;\n\nWe've had the privilege of introducing you to some of the best Catholic speakers in the world: Father Corapi, Scott Hahn, and Father Larry Richards. We can hardly wait for you to hear Chris West. He is without parallel. He's insightful, hilarious, caring, and full of infectious energy.\n\nIn &quot;Marriage and the Eucharist,&quot; Christopher has taken an extremely difficult and tightly-woven subject and &quot;unpacked&quot; it for us regular folks, yet without watering it down or losing any of its mighty spiritual firepower.\n\nNo man or woman on this planet apart from the Holy Father himself has put more time, sweat, prayer, natural ability, and sacrifice into the Theology of the Body than Christopher West. We believe Chris was born to introduce it to you.\n\nFinally, consider the title: Marriage and the Eucharist. Marriage is the foundation for all family life, culture and civilization. The Eucharist is the most important unifying supernatural Mystery of our life as Christians.\n\nBy applying John Paul II's Theology of the Body, Chris will unlock for you truths about these two profound realities of Christian life -- and how they are relatedÃ¢â‚¬â€œin fresh, exhilarating, and deeply insightful ways that will affect how you live your faith, your marriage, your life as son or daughter, and how you serve God Himself. (There is one section where Chris explains the Four Ways that God Loves. This alone can make hearing his presentation a life-changing experience.)\n\nA tidal wave. An explosion. We think you'll love it.\n\nAnd we'll end here. Not everything in this world can be explained by human reason. As Blaise Pascal said, &quot;the Heart has reasons that the Reason does not know.&quot;\n\nThe mystical reality of the Holy Catholic Faith, and Our Lord's unfathomable plans for each of us as individual souls are beyond any words or reasons that we can convey to you in an email.\n\nSo we'll conclude with how honored we are to be able to offer you this gift. We trust in your judgment and generosity.\n\nSo don't miss this opportunity. Visit our website or write in now to receive your free copies.
