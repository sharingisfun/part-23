The harsh truth is that the world is in its current state because humanity, as a world-wide population, is evolving and taking the world with it. We all now stand at the precipice of the greatest disaster mankind has ever known or it can be a great moment of mass awakening. From the legends of ancient shamanic tribes through the annals of organized religion, subtle clues of our salvation have been left for us to discover. Quantum science and metaphysics are confirming what these ancients knew all along, and these secrets to mankind's salvation are just beginning to be revealed. Will you make the tough choice to make personal changes for the benefit of all or allow the collective end of mankind to pass with a faint whimper?\r\n\r\nDirector: Benjamin Stewart (as Stewart Benjamin)\r\nStars: Bruce Lipton, Henrik Palmgren\r\n\r\nMovie . . . . . . . : Kymatica (2009)\r\nIMDb. . . . . . . . : imdb.com/title/tt2469524\r\nIMDb Rating . . . . : 7,9\r\nRuntime . . . . . . : 1h 24min\r\nGenre . . . . . . . : Documentary\r\nFile Size . . . . . : 1.47 GiB\r\nResolution. . . . . : 720x544 Pix\r\nFramerate . . . . . : 29.970 Fps\r\nLanguage. . . . . . : English\r\nSource. . . . . . . : DVD\r\nVideo Codec . . . . : XviD\r\nAudio Codec . . . . : MP3\r\nSample Rate . . . . : 48.0 KHz\r\nBitrate . . . . . . : 128 Kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:05ddbd008495a716aff9808208e2a2535db9633d","amp;dn":"Kymatica.2009.DVDRip.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"05ddbd008495a716aff9808208e2a2535db9633d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,221,189,0,132,149,167,22,175,249,128,130,8,226,162,83,93,185,99,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
