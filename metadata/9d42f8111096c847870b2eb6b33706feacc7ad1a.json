The case study of the operation of â€œEl hierroâ€ island is used as an example of the current effort towards more efficient use of the resources available.\r\nTackling head on the open challenges of the supply, the variability of the source and its prediction, the description of novel processes that are being developed and evaluated for their transformation as well as how we can distribute them to the consumer and how we can integrate the new chemicals, fuels and power within the current system and infrastructure, the book takes a process based perspective with such an approach able to help us in the use and integration of these sources of energy and novel technologies","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d42f8111096c847870b2eb6b33706feacc7ad1a","amp;dn":"Alternative+Energy+Sources+and+Technologies","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d42f8111096c847870b2eb6b33706feacc7ad1a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,66,248,17,16,150,200,71,135,11,46,182,179,55,6,254,172,199,173,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
