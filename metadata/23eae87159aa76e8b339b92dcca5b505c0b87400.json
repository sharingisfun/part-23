The e-mail address can be anything.\n\nYou can find serial number and customer number in the keygen. So you can generate these with the keygen and then manually add them to the registry, or you can, of course, also create a REG file and then merge with the registry.\n\nAfter you do this, you will NO LONGER have VueScan shitting watermarks on every printout. This should work for all 9.0 builds of VueScan.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:23eae87159aa76e8b339b92dcca5b505c0b87400","amp;dn":"Hamrick+VueScan+9.0.x+Crack+Only.zip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"23eae87159aa76e8b339b92dcca5b505c0b87400","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,234,232,113,89,170,118,232,179,57,185,45,204,165,181,5,192,184,116,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
