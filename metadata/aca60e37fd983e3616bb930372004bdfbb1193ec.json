Described in the liner notes as &quot;a form of community punishment practiced all over England&quot; (basically a public beating for a heinous social crime), Rough Music sounds like a lost pre-percussion Steeleye Span record filtered through A.L. Lloyd's whaling collection Leviathan! Carthy's strong fiddling and powerful vocals -- she really is beginning to surpass Norma -- are ably enhanced by the chiseled performance of her backing band, the Ratcatchers. Together they celebrate longstanding English traditions like public execution (&quot;Turpin Hero&quot;), syphilis (&quot;The Unfortunate Lass&quot;), and alcohol (&quot;Tom Brown&quot;) with equal parts reverence, earnestness, and mischief. Primarily arranged for violin, viola, double bass, and melodeon, Rough Music also features lovely a cappella cuts like &quot;Maid on the Shore&quot; and enough fiery instrumentals to keep your feet on the cobblestones during the long walk home from the pub. In fact, there's not a moment on Rough Music that isn't essential listening. Highly recommended. \n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/2011/05/14/eliza-carthy/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aca60e37fd983e3616bb930372004bdfbb1193ec","amp;dn":"Eliza+Carthy...+Rough+Music%282005%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aca60e37fd983e3616bb930372004bdfbb1193ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,166,14,55,253,152,62,54,22,187,147,3,114,0,75,223,187,17,147,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
