It carefully distinguishes between fascism as a mass movement before the seizure of power and fascism as an entrenched machinery of dictatorship. It compares the distinct class components of the counter-revolutionary blocs mobilzed by fascism in Germany and Italy; analyses the changing relations between the petty bourgeoisie and big capital in the evolution of fascism; discusses the structures of the fascist state itself, as an emergency regime for the defense of capital; and provides a sustained and documented criticism of official Comintern attitudes and policies towards fascism in the fateful years after the Versailles settlement. Fascism and Dictatorship represents a challenging synthesis of factual evidence and conceptual analysis that has been rare in Marxist political theory to date","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b18f85e629949774e662de72702b2a4b140f6c03","amp;dn":"Fascism+and+Dictatorship%3A+The+Third+International+and+the+Proble","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b18f85e629949774e662de72702b2a4b140f6c03","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,143,133,230,41,148,151,116,230,98,222,114,112,43,42,75,20,15,108,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
