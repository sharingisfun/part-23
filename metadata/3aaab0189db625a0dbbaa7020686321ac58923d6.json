Erland Cooper is a twentysomething Orcadian, his Carnival includes former Verve guitarist Simon Tong, and their second album ranges merrily across the millenniums, at one point cutting old English literature with the sort of ambient fidgeting that animates Radiohead's latest.

The results are never less than intriguing and occasionally sublime, not least on the head-swirlingly lovely &quot;East and West&quot;.\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2011/03/08/erland-and-the-carnival/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2011/03/08/erland-and-the-carnival/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3aaab0189db625a0dbbaa7020686321ac58923d6","amp;dn":"Erland+%26amp%3B+The+Carnival...Nightingale%282011%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3aaab0189db625a0dbbaa7020686321ac58923d6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,170,176,24,157,182,37,160,219,186,167,2,6,134,50,26,197,137,35,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
