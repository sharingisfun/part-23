There are three CDs bringing together the trio's earliest, out of print albums and previously unheard material: their eponymous debut (2000), She Knows (with Joe McPhee, from 2001) and a never-released forty-four-minute improv suite named Gluttony, recorded at the legendary Stockholm studio, Atlantis in 2005. As an extra treat, the combo's live appearance at Oslo's Oya festival in 2005 is included on DVD, featuring a notable set-closing collaboration with Thurston Moore. This is such a brilliant collection, and as if all that music wasn't enough (and it surely is) there's an extra treat for you: Eagle Eye Cherry (remember him, one hit wonder fans?) provides the liner notes. That's not quite as absurd as it initially sounds though: Eagle Eye is Don Cherry's son, and Don's music seems to be a recurring port of call for The Thing, with their eponymous debut album largely focused on the work of the legendary trumpeter. A massive recommendedation.\n~ boomkat","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e1914f098f16513dadcf0f9eab1f9ead7a155cca","amp;dn":"%7BPedro%27s+BTMusic%7DThe+Thing+-+Now+And+Forever+%282007%29+%5BFLAC%5D+%283CD+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e1914f098f16513dadcf0f9eab1f9ead7a155cca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,145,79,9,143,22,81,61,173,207,15,158,171,31,158,173,122,21,92,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
