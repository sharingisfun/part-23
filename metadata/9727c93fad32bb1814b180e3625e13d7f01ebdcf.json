While The Experience \nquickly became popular in England, they remained relatively \nunrecognised outside the country. It was not until their 1967 \nperformance at the Monterey International Pop Festival in the \nStates that The Experience became, quite literally overnight \none of the most popular bands of the era.\n\nHendrix was mostly self-taught on the guitar. He was ambidextrous \nbut chose to play the guitar upside-down and re-strung for playing \nleft-handed, which suggests that he was more comfortable left-handed. \nAs a guitarist, he built upon the innovations of blues stylists \nsuch as B.B. King, Albert King, Buddy Guy, T-Bone Walker, and \nMuddy Waters, as well as those of rhythm and blues and soul music \nguitarists such as Curtis Mayfield. HendrixÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s music was also \ninfluenced by jazz; he often cited Rahsaan Roland Kirk as his \nfavourite musician. In addition, Hendrix extended the tradition \nof rock guitar; although previous guitarists, such as The Kinks\nDave Davies, Jeff Beck, and The WhoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Pete Townshend, had employed \ntechniques such as feedback, distortion and other effects as sonic \ntools, Hendrix was able to exploit them to a previously undreamed-of \nextent, and made them an integral part of his own private \nunique genre, which he called Ã¢â‚¬Å“RedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. \n\n\n\nFile Format:FLAC\nCodec: LAME 3.99.5\nNumber of Albums: 01\nNumber of Tracks: 08\nVersion: MPEG 1 Layer III\nChannels: 2 Channels Stereo / 44100 Hz\nQuality:[FLAC avg. bitrate: 799 kbps]\nAlbum Title: Tomorrow Never Knows\nArtist / Group: Jimi Hendrix\nAlbum Release Year: 1991\nArtwork: Embedded Within Audio Files\nGenre: Blues Rock / Psychedelic Rock\nTotal Size: 318 MB [333,586,855 bytes]\nTotal Duration: 53:43.067 [142 137 240 samples]\nRipper:Exact Audio Copy V1.0 beta 3 - Secure Mode, Test &amp; Copy, AccurateRip\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://d22.e-loader.net/rWqrh0nYji.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://d22.e-loader.net/rWqrh0nYji.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://d12.e-loader.net/ETcOHyVytq.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://d12.e-loader.net/ETcOHyVytq.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://d4.e-loader.net/uUl0LZanml.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://d4.e-loader.net/uUl0LZanml.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n01 - Red House [10mn 57s ][ 782 Kbps ][ 61.5 MiB ] \n02 - Woke Up This Morning and Found Yourself Dead [8mn 4s ][ 824 Kbps ][ 47.8 MiB ] \n03 - Bleeding Heart [12mn 29s ][ 766 Kbps ][ 68.7 MiB ] \n04 - Morrison's Lament [3mn 30s ][ 717 Kbps ][ 18.2 MiB ] \n05 - Tomorrow Never Knows [5mn 10s ][ 826 Kbps ][ 30.8 MiB ] \n06 - Uranus Rock [3mn 13s ][ 806 Kbps ][ 18.8 MiB ] \n07 - Outside Woman Blues [8mn 8s ][ 867 Kbps ][ 50.7 MiB ] \n08 - Sunshine of Your Love [2mn 10s ][ 782 Kbps ][ 12.4 MiB ] \n\n\n.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9727c93fad32bb1814b180e3625e13d7f01ebdcf","amp;dn":"Jimi+Hendrix+-+Tomorrow+Never+Knows+1991+%5BEAC+-+FLAC%5D%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9727c93fad32bb1814b180e3625e13d7f01ebdcf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,39,201,63,173,50,187,24,20,177,128,227,98,94,19,215,240,30,189,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
