Singing has a group of damaged sectors intermittently for 15 seconds of track 9; I did not detect any problems with playback and, because of the lack of this album's availability in lossless, I included it here. Ripped with XLD in XLD Secure Ripper mode on a Mac G5 into Apple Lossless and then converted to FLAC.\n\nDon't Wake Me Up\nIt Was Hot, We Stayed In the Water\nThe Glow, Pt. 2 (Remaster/Reissue, Disc One only)\nThe Drums from Mt.
