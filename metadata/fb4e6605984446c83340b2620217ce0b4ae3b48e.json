From ancient China to modern-day Minnesota, the\nbook discusses the history and structural evaluation of bridges, as well as their preservation, and restoration. With\nchapters written by renowned engineers, this unique resource aÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\nCompares the techniques and materials used in building three railroad bridges that traversed the Mississippi at the\nsame site in 1865, 1887, and 1910 Investigates a legendary stone-arch bridge constructed in Ancient China in 606 A.D.\n\nDemonstrates how historians and engineers in Milwaukee found an approach to new bridge design that balances modern\ndesign standards with aesthetic interpretation Details a collaborative team approach to historic bridge management in\nMinnesota Considers the design and repair process of rapidly disappearing wrought iron bridges Discusses preservation\nof stone masonry aqueducts on the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal\nAn educational treatise for engineers and historical preservationists, this work includes a wealth of illustrations\nand scientific tables. Demonstrating historic engineering significance beyond their utilitarian function, the bridges\nencountered in these pages are true landmarks, as worthy of emulation as they are preservation.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb4e6605984446c83340b2620217ce0b4ae3b48e","amp;dn":"Historic+Bridges+-+Evaluation%2C+Preservation%2C+and+Management+%28Mal","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb4e6605984446c83340b2620217ce0b4ae3b48e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,78,102,5,152,68,70,200,51,64,178,98,2,23,206,11,74,227,180,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
