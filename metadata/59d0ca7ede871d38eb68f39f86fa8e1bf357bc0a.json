These songs are available on other compilations, but this disc offers a decent '60s rock collection for casual fans.&quot; (Gina Boldman - AllMusic)\n\nNice compilation of 60's oldies. All are ripped in Flac as well as MP3 at 320 kbps.\n\nEnjoy,\n\nJediMaster","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:59d0ca7ede871d38eb68f39f86fa8e1bf357bc0a","amp;dn":"Classic+60s+The+Beat+Goes+On+%28Flac+%2B+MP3%29+JediMaster","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"59d0ca7ede871d38eb68f39f86fa8e1bf357bc0a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,208,202,126,222,135,29,56,235,104,243,159,134,250,142,27,243,87,188,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
