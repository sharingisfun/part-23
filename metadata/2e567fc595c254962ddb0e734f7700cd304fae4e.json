His first new release in five years, it wasn't one of King's better records -- but it did represent a return to a basic five-piece sound, an improvement upon his over-produced outings of the late '70s. (AllMusic)\n\nTrack list:\n01 - Honey Bee\n02 - Ask Me No Questions\n03 - I'm Gonna Move To The Outskirts of Town\n04 - They Made The Queen Welcome\n05 - Floodin' In California\n06 - I Found Love In The Food Stamp Line\n07 - Match Box Blues\n08 - Crosscut Saw\n09 - Why You So Mean To Me\n\nEnjoy and share!
