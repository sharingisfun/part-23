The black-and-white filmed show starred William Lundigan as Col. Edward McCauley.\n\nVideo files were optimized with WinFF for smooth playback via Google Chromecast. \n\nWinFF video converter added to convert your own video files to be more compatible with Google Chromecast.\n\n\nVideo: H264 --- Audio: AAC (m4a)\n\nIMDB rating 8.0 --- http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0052493/\n\nThe series was not set in a specific era, but clues throughout the scripts indicated that it took place in the mid-1970s to mid-1980s, with the first moon landing somewhere around 1975. Props were occasionally futuristic (such as a forerunner of today's real-life LCD TVs) but the show's earthly clothing and environs, including automobiles, telephones and other machines, were decidedly 1950s. However, a line of dialogue in &quot;Christmas on the Moon,&quot; suggests that the events of that episode take place 2,000 years after the birth of Christ.\n\n\n---\n\n\nHomeNet WiFi Media Center ( Windows / Linux / Mac )\n   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.homenetvideo.com/demo/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.homenetvideo.com/demo/&lt;/a&gt;\n   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.homenetvideo.com/readme.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.homenetvideo.com/readme.html&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed2a3e2baf563fd3bf1960186b790c8bdaf7b94b","amp;dn":"Men+Into+Space+-+scifi+1959-1960+Chromecast+x264+MP4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed2a3e2baf563fd3bf1960186b790c8bdaf7b94b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,42,62,43,175,86,63,211,191,25,96,24,107,121,12,139,218,247,185,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
