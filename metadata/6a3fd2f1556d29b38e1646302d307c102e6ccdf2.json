Numerous scholars and commentators maintain that the Qur'an and Hadith rule unambiguously against same-sex relations. This pioneering study argues that there is far more nuance to the matter than most believe.\n\nScott Kugle is the first Muslim to publish widely on the issue of homosexuality and Islam. An independent research scholar in Islamic studies, he has previously held positions at Duke University, the University of Cape Town, and Swarthmore College.\n\nAuthor: Scott Siraj al-Haqq Kugle\nPublisher: University Of Chicago Press\nPublication Date: April 1, 2009\n\nFormats:\n.mobi (compatible with Amazon Kindle, etc.)\n.epub (compatible with Sony Reader, Cruz Reader, iPad, iPodTouch/iPhone, etc.)\n\nFree Calibre eBook reader: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://calibre-ebook.com/download&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://calibre-ebook.com/download&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a3fd2f1556d29b38e1646302d307c102e6ccdf2","amp;dn":"Scott+Siraj+al-Haqq+Kugle+-+Homosexuality+in+Islam+%28mobi%2C+epub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a3fd2f1556d29b38e1646302d307c102e6ccdf2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,63,210,241,85,109,41,179,142,22,70,48,45,48,124,16,46,108,205,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
