Little Spark (3:15)\n\nHaving recorded two albums and some EPs, Jessie Baylin's Little Spark presents a confident singer-songwriter, rather than that of an indie artist struggling to find her voice.\nThis could easily be described as one of those albums that attempts to lock onto a &quot;retro&quot; sound. Baylin, however, is smart enough to know that time, as well as music, moves forward. It is for this reason that I loved every bit of this album.\n\nOf the 11 solid tracks that make up this album, &quot;The Greatest Thing That Never Happened To Me&quot;, &quot;Dancer&quot; and &quot;The Winds&quot; are the ones I felt most connected to. I dug the first one because it sort of makes you think you are listening to a more somber sounding version of Sara Bareilles' &quot;Love Song&quot;. The second one appeals to me because it's always nice to have a track you can imagine playing while kissing your girlfriend. I like the third track because it sounds like the kind of song that would be played during the more hellish times during a relationship.\nI credit the album's producer, Kevin Augunas, and chief arranger Richard Swift with Little Spark's retro vibe without completely lacing each track as if it were from that era. In a time where music seems to want to cherry-pick styles of music from decades past, it's good to know a couple of guys came together with such a love for the past without completely feeling lost in it.\nI wouldn't be surprised if this album was able to get some kind of nomination for an award. It has a bit of an underdog quality and frankly showcases that Jessie Baylin could be a force to be reckoned with in the future. Every year can't be Bieber, Bieber, Bieber all the time.\n\nX Lossless Decoder version 20120120 (139.0)\n\n[img]http://i809.photobucket.com/albums/zz12/elitter/fd0138fdb1-1.gif[/img]\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/about/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/about/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:20e4a9810e1fb97c0f68113592a9c584162af438","amp;dn":"Jessie+Baylin...Little+Spark%282012%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"20e4a9810e1fb97c0f68113592a9c584162af438","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,228,169,129,14,31,185,124,15,104,17,53,146,169,197,132,22,42,244,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
